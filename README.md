# HARM-bench: Benchmarking AI Robustness Against Harmful Speech

## Introduction
HARM-bench is a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the resilience of language models (LLMs) against a diverse range of biases and harmful speech scenarios. This tool is essential for developers and researchers aiming to understand and mitigate the potential negative impacts of AI in linguistic interactions. It includes over 8,000 paired questions and answers that exemplify both harmful and neutral responses across more than 100 identified themes of bias and harmful expressions.

## Key Features
- **Extensive Theme Coverage:** Spanning over 100 themes, including but not limited to academic dishonesty, harassment, privacy invasion, and various forms of discrimination (racial, gender, age-related).
- **Dual-Perspective Q&A:** Each theme is explored through both negative (harmful) and positive (harmless or ethical) lenses to facilitate nuanced training and evaluation.
- **Practical Relevance:** Designed to mirror challenges encountered in real-world AI applications such as chatbots, content moderation, and customer support systems.

## Example Themes and Entries
