        "answer": "Let's say we have an optic element with jones matrix, $J$. If we rotate the optic element and keep everything the same then the jones matrix for the element will change to $J^{\\text {rotated }}$. If we have input $I$ and output $O$, then $J I=O$. The trick is that we rotate the input beam instead of the optic elements. In fact, two cases are identical, whether you rotate the polarization of the input/output beams or you rotate the optic elements. Rotating matrix for the beam represented by Jones vector is shown in part $A$ that is\n\n$$\nR(\\beta)=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\n\\cos \\beta & -\\sin (\\beta) \\\\\n\\sin (\\beta) & \\cos \\beta\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\nSo if we rotate the input $I$ and the output $O$ beams, the Jones vector representations will be $I^{\\text {rotated }}=R(\\beta) I$ and $O^{\\text {rotated }}=R(\\beta) O$ respectively. As $J I=O$, then $O^{\\text {rotated }}=R(\\beta) J I$.\n\nIf we insert identity matrix $R^{-1}(\\beta) R(\\beta)$ then:\n\n$O^{\\text {rotated }}=R(\\beta) J I=R(\\beta) J R^{-1}(\\beta) R(\\beta) I=R(\\beta) J R^{-1}(\\beta) I^{r o t a t e d}$. That means this rotation changed the Jones matrix representation to Jotated $^{\\text {rot }}=R(\\beta) J R^{-1}(\\beta)$. Keep this in mind; for the exam you will need it!\n\nOK, let's find the Jones matrix $J$ for a polarizer whose transmission axis is vertical. It should allow only $\\hat{y}$ component and reject $\\hat{x}$ component. That means the input $\\left[\\begin{array}{l}0 \\\\ 1\\end{array}\\right]$ will go through this polarizer without any change and the input $\\left[\\begin{array}{l}1 \\\\ 0\\end{array}\\right]$ will be rejected.\n\n$$\nJ=\\left[\\begin{array}{ll}\na & b \\\\\nc & d\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\nSo we have: $\\left[\\begin{array}{ll}a & b \\\\ c & d\\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{l}0 \\\\ 1\\end{array}\\right]=\\left[\\begin{array}{l}0 \\\\ 1\\end{array}\\right]$ and $\\left[\\begin{array}{ll}a & b \\\\ c & d\\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{l}1 \\\\ 0\\end{array}\\right]=\\left[\\begin{array}{l}0 \\\\ 0\\end{array}\\right]$. Solving these 2 equations: $J=\\left[\\begin{array}{ll}a & b \\\\ c & d\\end{array}\\right]=\\left[\\begin{array}{ll}0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1\\end{array}\\right]$.\n\nIf we rotate the polarizer by 45 degree:\n\n$$\nJ^{\\text {rotated }}=R(\\beta=45) J R^{-1}(\\beta=45)=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\n\\cos 45 & -\\sin 45 \\\\\n\\sin 45 & \\cos 45\n\\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\n0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1\n\\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\n\\cos 45 & \\sin 45 \\\\\n-\\sin 45 & \\cos 45\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\nNow, let's check the all system\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[max width=\\textwidth]{2023_04_12_e6c583718aa5bfc3779eg-5}\n\\end{center}\n\nThe input is horizontally polarized (input $=\\left[\\begin{array}{l}1 \\\\ 0\\end{array}\\right]$ ), then one polarizer is rotated by 45 degrees and then the other one is vertically polarized.\n\nThe output will be:\n\n$$\n\\text { output }=J J^{\\text {rotated }} \\text { input }=\\left[\\begin{array}{ll}\n0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1\n\\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\n\\cos 45 & -\\sin 45 \\\\\n\\sin 45 & \\cos 45\n\\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{ll}\n0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1\n\\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\n\\cos 45 & \\sin 45 \\\\\n-\\sin 45 & \\cos 45\n\\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{l}\n1 \\\\\n0\n\\end{array}\\right]=\\cdots=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}\n0 \\\\\n-1 / 2\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\nThis is orthogonal to the input!",

The reason of this voltage-dependence is different than the voltage-gated sodium/potassium/calcium channels. The NMDA receptors aren't intrinsically voltage-sensitive, but they gain that attribute because of a magnesium block. Magnesium ions enter the NMDA receptor channel pore at negative potentials, interacting with pore-lining amino acid residues and blocking the NMDA receptors. The magnesium ions induce a fast flickering block, as they stochastically enter and leave the ion channel pore. When the cell depolarizes, the magnesium is repelled from the internal binding site by the electric field and the NMDA receptor can fully conduct.",

        "answer": "We could consider at least two approaches here: either binomial confidence interval or t-test. • binomial confidence interval: evaluation of a binary classifier (success or not) follow a binomial law with parameters (perror,T), where T is the test-set size (157 in the above question; is it big enough?). Using normal approximation of the binomial law, the width of the confidence interval around estimated error probability is q(α)*sqrt(pb*(1-pb)/T),where q(α) is the 1-α quantile (for a 1 - α confidence level) and pb is the estimation of perror. We here want this confidence interval width to be 0.02, and have pb = 0.118 (and 'know' that q(0.05) = 1.96 from normal distribution quantile charts); thus we have to solve: (0.02)^2 = (1.96)^2*(0.118*(1-0.118))/T Thus T ≃ 1000. • t-test approach: let's consider estimating their relative behaviour on each of the test cases (i.e. each test estimation subset is of size 1). If the new system as an error of 0.098 (= 0.118 - 0.02), it can vary from system 3 between 0.02 of the test cases (both systems almost always agree but where the new system improves the results) and 0.216 of the test cases (the two systems never make their errors on the same test case, so they disagree on 0.118 + 0.098 of the cases). Thus μ of the t-test is between 0.02 and 0.216. And s = 0.004 (by assumption, same variance). Thus t is between 5*sqrt(T) and 54*sqrt(T) which is already bigger than 1.645 for any T bigger than 1. So this doesn't help much. So all we can say is that if we want to have a (lowest possible) difference of 0.02 we should have at least 1/0.02 = 50 test cases ;-) And if we consider that we have 0.216 difference, then we have at least 5 test cases... The reason why these numbers are so low is simply because we here make strong assumptions about the test setup: that it is a paired evaluation. In such a case, having a difference (0.02) that is 5 times bigger than the standard deviation is always statistically significant at a 95% level.",

        "answer": "The standard approach to vector semantics can be decomposed into two mains steps:\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n  \\item the indexing (or desequalization) phase: during this phase, the documents for which a vectorial semantic representation needs to be produced, are processed with linguistic tools in order to identify the indexing features (words, stems, lemmas, ...) they will be associated with.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nThis phase results in the association with each of the documents of a set of indexing features. Notice that, for the rest of the processing, on the sets of indexing features will be considered. The rest of the documents will be ignored. Notice also that the sets of indexing features are sets!... and that therefore any notion of word order is lost after the indexing phase.\n\nFor example, if we consider the toy document collection consisting of the two following documents: D1 = 'the results of the experiments on transgenic plants\n\nwill be issued soon.'\n\nD2 = 'as soon as the experiments will be over, the laboratory\n\nwill close.'\n\nA possible output of the indexing phase for these documents might be:\n\nD1 $->$ \\{result, experiment, transgenic, plant, issue\\}\n\nD2 --> \\{experiment, over, laboratory, close\\}\n\nbut it is important to notice that the order of the word lemmas in the indexing sets is in fact meaningless, and D1 and D2 might be equivalently indexed by:\n\nD1 --> \\{experiment, issue, plant, result, transgenic\\}\n\nD2 $->$ \\{close, experiment, laboratory, over\\}\n\nwhere the indexing features have been arbitrarily put in alphabetic order.\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n  \\item The second step of the vector semantics modeling is the representation phase.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nDuring this phase, each of the indexing features that have been identified is associated with one of the dimensions of a (usually highly dimensional) vector space and a method must be designed to transform the indexing sets associated with the documents into vectors.\n\nA possible approach is to use binary vectors in which the $0 / 1$ coordinates simply indicated whether the corresponding indexing feature is or is not associated with a given document.\n\nA more sophisticated approach consists in using the occurrence statistics of the indexing features in the documents to derive less brittle importance scores for each of the indexing features appearing in a document. A simple version of this approach if to use the (usually normalized) occurrence frequency of a feature in a document as a measure of the importance of this feature for the document. For example, a feature appearing in a document 3 times more frequently than another will be considered as three times more important for that document.\n\nThe importance scores can then be used as coordinates for the vectors representing the topical content of the documents.\n\nOnce each of the documents can be represented in the indexing feature vector space, the remaining problem is to define a similarity in this vector space in order to be able to evaluate the semantic proximities between the documents.\n\nThe standard approach is to use the cosine similarity, defined as:\n\nif V1 is the vector representing document D1 and V2 is the vector representing document D2\n\nthe semantic proximity between $\\mathrm{D} 1$ and $\\mathrm{D} 2$ is simply defined as:\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{sim}\\left(D_{1}, D_{2}\\right)=\\cos \\left(V_{1}, V_{2}\\right)=\\frac{V_{1} \\cdot V_{2}}{\\|V 1\\|\\|V 2\\|}\n$$\n\nwhere $X \\cdot Y$ denotes the dot-product between vector $X$ and vector $Y$, and $\\|X\\|=\\sqrt{X \\cdot X}$ represents the norm (i.e. the length) of vector $X$. Notice that this simple similarity might be further sophisticated in order to take into account varying importance for the various dimensions of the vector space.\n\nA possible approach is to use a weighted dot-product of the form:\n\nfor $V 1=\\left(v_{11}, v_{12}, \\ldots, v_{1 n}\\right)$\n\nand $V 2=\\left(v_{21}, v_{22}, \\ldots, v_{2 n}\\right)$\n\n$V_{1} \\cdot V 2=\\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} v_{1 i} v_{2 i}$, where the $a_{i}$ are some (usually positive) coefficients.\n\nA standard approach for the weighting of the vector space dimensions is to use the 'inverse document frequency' (i.e. fact any function $f()$ decreasing with the document frequency of an indexing feature, i.e. the inverse of the number of documents containing the given indexing feature).\n\nFor example, if we take: ai $=\\operatorname{idf}(\\mathrm{i}) 2=\\log (1 / \\mathrm{DF}(\\mathrm{i})) 2$, where $\\mathrm{DF}(\\mathrm{i})$ is the document frequency of the indexing feature associated with the i-th dimension of the vector space, we get:\n\n$\\operatorname{sim}(\\mathrm{D} 1, \\mathrm{D} 2)=\\cos \\left(\\mathrm{V} 1^{\\prime}, \\mathrm{V}^{\\prime}\\right)$, where $\\mathrm{Vi}^{\\prime}=(\\mathrm{tf}(\\mathrm{i}, \\mathrm{k}) \\cdot \\operatorname{idf}(\\mathrm{k}))$, where $\\mathrm{tf}(\\mathrm{i}, \\mathrm{k})$ is the measure of importance of the k-th indexing feature for the $\\mathrm{i}$-th document and $\\operatorname{idf}(\\mathrm{k})$ is a measure of importance of the k-th dimension of the vector space.\n\nThis approach corresponds to the standard 'tf.idf' weighting scheme.",

For example, it is sufficient that one (or more) document(s) contain(s) the two words 'car' and 'vehicle' to imply that sim('car', 'vehicle') $=0$ which should be interpreted as the (not very convincing) fact that 'car' and 'vehicle' has nothing in common.\n\nA possible (partial) solution for this problem is to use more sophisticated representation techniques such the Distributional Semantics (DS).\n\nIn DS, the semantic content of an indexing feature does not only rely on its occurrences in the document collection, but also on the co-occurrences of this indexing feature with other indexing features appearing the the same documents. In fact, the vectorial representations use in DS are a mixture of the standard occurrence vectors (as they are used in the traditional vector space model) with the co-occurrence vectors characterizing the indexing features appearing in the documents. Thus, even is the similarity between the occurrence vectors of 'car' and 'vehicle' have, by definition, a zero similarity, in DS, the vectors representing the documents are of the form:\n\n$\\mathrm{V}(\\mathrm{D})=\\mathrm{a}^{*} \\operatorname{Occ} \\mathrm{V}(\\mathrm{D})+(1-\\mathrm{a})^{*} \\operatorname{Cooc} V(D)$\n\nand therefore, is 'car' and 'vehicle' share some co-occurrences (i.e. appear in documents together with some identical words), their similarity will not be zero anymore.",

        "explanation": "A self-limiting reaction is a reaction which stops once all reactive sites on the substrate surface are occupied. In ALCVD, this involves the formation of a monolayer by using a precursor gas, which covers the surface of a substrate and thereby depletes all available reaction sites.

        "explanation": "At atmospheric pressure, local variations in the gas concentration are common and would result in uneven deposition rates across the surface of the substrate. These variations can be reduced by lowering the pressure in the reactor.

A pressure of 400 Pa corresponds to about 3 Torr. As a result, the pressure times inter-electrodes distance product is 45 Torr*cm. According to the graph shown in the slide about Paschen’s law, we can see that this value is higher that the value for which the breakdown voltage is minimal. Thus, two solutions are possible to decrease the required breakdown voltage; either decrease the inter-electrode distance or decrease the pressure. Practically, the inter-electrode distance cannot be easily changed in a sputtering tool so it is the gas pressure which has to be lowered.",

This can give rise to plane-dependent etching rates. A Si atom in (111) plane has 3 backbonds and 1 dangling bond whereas for a Si atom in (100) plane, there are 2 backbonds and 2 dangling bonds.

        "answer": "Cependant nous savons que l’arbre de décision optimal est l’arbre correspondant à un codage de Huffman de la situation.\nDans le cas où le nombre de feuilles (c’est-à-dire le nombre de cas à tester – des verres, en l’occurence) est une puissance de deux, cet arbre optimal est effectivement l’arbre équilibré auquel pense l’auteur. Cependant, dans le cas où le nombre de feuilles n’est justement pas une puissance de deux mais, par exemple, une puissance de deux plus un, l’arbre n’est pas l’arbre équilibré avec une branche supplémentaire à son sommet. C’est précisément l’idée clé de Huffman et du codage (optimal) que de procéder à la fin et non pas au début à ce test, peut-être inutile !\nQuel est le nombre moyen de tests ? Soit N = 2n + 1 le nombre de verres. La plupart du temps, n = ⌊log2 N⌋ tests détermineront la situation, sauf quand le verre empoisonné est dans le dernier groupe de deux verres (pas de chance !). Dans ce cas, il faut un test de plus. Mais ceci n’arrive en moyenne que dans 2 cas sur N. Le nombre moyen de tests est donc :\n\n  T = (N-2)/N * floor(log_2(N)) + 2/N * (floor(log_2(N)) + 1) = floor(log_2(N)) + 2/N\n\nAvec la procédure suggérée par l’auteur du problème, c’est-à-dire la dichotomie, le nombre de tests est 1 si, par chance, le verre empoisonné est choisi en premier (ce qui se produit avec une probabilité de 1/N ). Il faut 1 + floor(log2(N)) tests dans les autres cas. Le nombre moyen de tests de la procédure du mathématicien est donc de :\n  T = 1/N + (N - 1)/N * (1 + floor(log_2(N))) = log_2(N) + (N - floor(log_2(N)))/N\n\nEn moyenne on gagne donc (N−floor(log2(N))−2)/N tests avec la procédure vraiment optimale! N\nPour 129 verres, en moyenne la procédure du mathématicien conduit à 7.95 tests et la pro- cédure optimale à 7.02 tests.\nA 10’000 francs le test, cela fait déjà une petite différence !",
        "question": "J’ai lu un jour, dans une revue pseudo-scientifique, le problème suivant :\n« Les mathématiciens sont vraiment des gens étranges! » dit un commissaire à sa femme. « L’autre jour, nous avions toute cette rangée de verres d’une réception dont nous savions qu’un (et un seul) était empoisonné. Évidemment, notre laboratoire aurait pu tester les verres les uns après les autres, mais cela aurait coûté très cher! Il nous fallait donc trouver une procédure déterminant le verre empoisonné en le moins de tests possibles, moyennant des mélanges de petits échantillons prélevés dans les verres. Vint alors ce mathématicien. J’ignore d’ailleurs d’où il venait. Il regarda les verres, qu’il était vraisemblablement en train de compter, puis me dit en souriant : « Mon cher commissaire, choisissez un verre au hasard et testez-le ». « Mais ce serait un gaspillage d’argent ! » dis-je, « pourquoi effectuer un test inutile ? ». « Non », me répondit-il, « cela fait partie de la meilleure procédure ! On peut tester en premier un seul verre, peut importe lequel. » »\n« Et combien y avait-il de verres ? » demanda sa femme.\n« Je ne me souviens pas exactement. Entre 100 et 200 je pense. » répondit le commissaire. Combien y avait-il de verres ?\nVoilà comment le problème était posé.

La seule différence avec le cours, c’est qu’ici on compare aussi avec « l’élément du\n    milieu » (c dans l’algorithme).\n    Rappel du fonctionnement de l’algorithme : Étant donnés une liste L triée par ordre\n    croissant, un objet x et des bornes a ≤ b, il cherche l’emplacement dans L entre les indices a et b\n    qui contient x. Une manière de chercher dans toute la liste est de choisir a = 1 et b = taille de L.\n    L’algorithme procède en affinant successivement l’intervalle de recherche. À chaque étape, x\n    est comparé à l’élément c situé au milieu de l’intervalle actuel, et un appel récursif est effectué\n    sur un nouvel intervalle réduit de moitié. Lorsque l’intervalle a été réduit à un seul élément\n    (a = b), soit l’élément est équivalent à x et l’indice est retourné, soit la liste ne contient pas x et\n    l’algorithme retourne 0 (indice impossible pour un élément).\n    Exactitude : Sans autre contraintes sur a et b, cet algorithme n’est pas correct dans tous les\n    cas.\n    Si en entrée a > b, il peut arriver qu’il ne termine pas en raison d’un nombre infini d’appels\n    récursifs.\n    Par ailleurs, si a est plus grand que le nombre d’éléments dans la liste, « le a-ième » ou « le\n    c-ième élément de L » ne sont pas définis.\n    De plus, la contrainte a ≤ b n’est même pas garantie dans tous les cas dans l’algorithme\n    lui-même ! En effet, si x < L(a) et b = a + 1 alors on lancera devinette(L, x, a, a − 1) ! Essayez\n    par exemple avec L = {2, 3}, x = 1, a = 1 et b = 2.\n    Le plus simple serait donc d’ajouter un test au début de l’algorithme pour garantir 1 ≤ a ≤\n    b ≤ taille(L) et répondre 0 sinon.",

        "answer": "Il est possible de le démontrer formellement par récurrence. Une version de cette technique\n    permet de démontrer qu’une proposition P (n) est vérifiée pour tout nombre entier n en procédant\n    comme suit :\n    1. on démontre que P (n) est vérifiée pour un certain entier n connu ; par exemple n = 1 ou\n    n = 2 ; on démontre cela par exemple par calcul direct ;\n    2. ensuite, on démontre que, si P (i) est vérifiée pour tout entier inférieur ou égal à n, alors\n    P (n + 1) est aussi vérifiée.\n    Dans notre cas, avant d’entrer dans la récurrence, montrons tout d’abord que, pour tout\n    a ∈ N∗ , pour tout constante k ∈ N∗ et pour tout b ∈ N∗ on a :\n    algo(k × a, b) = k × algo(a, b).\n    En effet, les opérations impliquant (directement ou indirectement) la valeur de la première entrée\n    (a) sont :\n    — l’initialisation x ←− a ; si l’on remplace a par k × a alors x sera aussi k fois plus grand ;\n    — la multiplication par 2 de x si y est pair : là aussi, si x est k fois plus grand au départ, il\n    l’est encore par la suite ;\n    — l’addition de x à z. Comme 0 (valeur initiale de z) est égal à k × 0, cette opération\n    (z ←− z + x), qui est la seule sur z, fera également que z sera k fois plus grand si x est k\n    fois plus grand ; or z est justement le résultat de l’algorithme.\n    On peut alors commencer la preuve par récurrence sur b pour a fixé :\n    1. On vérifie par calcul direct que, pour b = 1 ou même b = 2, on a effectivement :\n    algo(a, b) = a × b.\n    2. Soit b ∈ N∗ . On cherche à démontrer que, si ∀a ∈ N∗ ∀i ∈ N∗ i ≤ b algo(a, b) = a × b,\n    alors algo(a, b + 1) = a × (b + 1). Pour cela, on peut procéder comme suit :\n    (a) si b + 1 est pair, c.-à-d. il existe c tel que b + 1 = 2 c, alors :\n    algo(a, b + 1) = algo(a, 2 c) = 2 a × c,\n    (2)\n    En effet, par le premier branchement conditionnel de l’algorithme on a algo(a, 2 c) =\n    algo(2 a, c) (puisque 2 c est un nombre pair). Or algo(2 a, c) = 2 × algo(a, c) par\n    le résultat (1) ci-dessus. Et comme c ≤ b, on a alors par hypothèse de récurrence\n    algo(a, c) = a × c.\n    Donc si b + 1 est pair, on a bien algo(a, b + 1) = a × (b + 1).\n    (b) Si b + 1 est impair, c.-à-d. il existe c tel que b + 1 = 2 c + 1, alors :\n    algo(a, b + 1) = algo(a, 2 c + 1) = a × (2 c + 1) = a × (b + 1)\n    En effet, puisque 2 c + 1 est un nombre impair, par la 2e partie du branchement\n    conditionel de l’algorithme, nous avons\n    algo(a, 2 c + 1) = a + algo(a, 2 c)\n    Ensuite, en utilisant le résultat (2), on obtient bien que algo(a, 2 c + 1) = a + 2 a × c =\n    a × (2 c + 1).\n    Ceci conclut la démonstration pour tous les cas.

La carapace de tels insectes présente à l'échelle sub-micrométrique des structures périodiques agissant comme un réseau de diffraction.

Mais, cet exercice a pour but que les \\'etudiants d\\'ecouvrent un contexte un peu plus large. D'abord recapitulons les d\\'efinitions n\\'ecessaires.Rappel de définitions :\\begin{itemize} \\item[i)] Soient $m,n \\geq 1$ entiers. Une transformation $T:\\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}^m$ est appel\\'ee \\emph{transformation matricielle} s'il existe une matrice $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times n}$ telle que $T(\\vec x) = A\\vec x$ pour tout $\\vec x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$. \\item[ii)] Soient $V,W$ deux espaces vectoriels r\\'eels. Une transformation $T:V \\to W$ est appel\\'ee \\emph{transformation lin\\'eaire} si $T$ satisfait \\begin{align*}  T(u+v) = T(u) + T(v), \\quad T(\\lambda u) = \\lambda T(u), \\qquad \\text{pour tous } u,v \\in V, \\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}. \\end{align*}\\end{itemize}Les relations entre transformations matricielles et transformations linéaires sont r\\'esum\\'ees ci-dessous:\\begin{itemize} \\item Chaque transformation matricielle est une transformation lin\\'eaire. \\item Soit $T:\\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}^m$ une transformation lin\\'eaire, alors il existe une unique matrice $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times n}$ telle que $T(\\vec x) = A\\vec x$ pour tout $\\vec x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$. En effet, la transformation lin\\'eaire $T$ est une transformation matricielle. \\item Soit $T:V \\to W$ une transformation lin\\'eaire, o\\`u $V,W$ sont des espaces vectoriels r\\'eels de dimension finie. En choisissant des bases de $V$ et $W$ et en introduisant les syst\\`emes de coordonn\\'ees par rapport \\`a ces deux bases, la transformation $T$ dans ces syst\\`emes de coordonn\\'ees peut \\^etre repr\\'esent\\'ee par une matrice. \\item Soit $T:V \\to W$ une transformation lin\\'eaire, o\\`u l'un des espaces vectoriels $V, W$ est de dimension infinie. Dans ce cas, il n'existe pas de repr\\'esentation matricielle de la transformation lin\\'eaire $T$.\\end{itemize}Ce dernier point est illustr\\'e par l'exemple suivant: soit $C([0,1])$ l'ensemble des fonctions continues $f:[0,1] \\to \\mathbb{R}$.

The local membrane potential is only briefly depolarised by a very large amount in the dendrite, because axial currents then rapidly spread the depolarisation.

Firstly, motor control is very important for sensory perception, as we actively gather sensory information by making voluntary movements. For example, we make eye and head movements to see specific parts of the visual field, or we move our hands and fingers to touch objects so as to actively get tactile sensory information. Secondly, sensory perception is an active process in another way, in which our neuronal activity can actively generate our sensory percepts. As such, sensory percepts are subjective, and this can easily be understood by looking at images that evoke alternating percepts.

In particular, D1R- and D2R-expressing striatal projection neurons exert opposing effects upon the SNr. The direct pathway, which involves D1R-expressing projection neurons, directly innervates and inhibits SNr. On the other hand, the indirect pathway that involves D2R-expressing projection neurons, innervates and inhibits the GPe, which in turn inhibits SNr. Therefore, the more inhibition that GPe receives from the D2 striatal projection neurons, the less inhibition it sends to the SNR. Thus, the indirect striatal projection neurons induce a disinhibitory effect that leads to an increase of the SNr firing. SNr contains tonically active GABAergic neurons, that at least in part serve to inhibit motor ouput. Inhibiting SNr, therefore allows motor output, forming a 'go' sigal. Disinhibition of SNr, will contribute to stronger suppression motor output, forming a 'no go' signal.",

On peut tester en premier un seul verre, peut importe lequel. » »\n« Et combien y avait-il de verres ? » demanda sa femme.\n« Je ne me souviens pas exactement.

Si, en effet, l’élève est capable de trouver x tel que e_A(x) = N, c’est qu’il a craqué le système RSA (au moins pour ce cas précis).\nSupposons donc que l’élève tricheur n’ait pas craqué le système [hypothèse, encore une fois, difficilement vérifiée dans le cas trivial de cet exercice.] ; il ne peut donc pas falsifier la note qu’il veut.

Ceci est dû à la petitesse des messages et à la simplicité des clés. Dans la réalité, la chance est de 1 sur le nombre de valeurs possibles (n_A − 1) puisque x → x^(d_A) mod n_A est une bijection de [[1, n_A]] dans lui-même.

However, to help Coop and Migros in their  supply-chain management, he needs to calculate the total cheese consumption of those persons that prefer fondue over raclette. That is, if we let $F \\subseteq U$ be those that prefer fondue over raclette, then Ueli wants to calculate \\begin{align*} W_F = \\sum_{i\\in F} w_i\\,. \\end{align*} The issue is that Ueli does not know the set $F$ and he does not have the time or energy to ask the preferences of all persons. He therefore designs two estimators that only ask a single person: \\begin{description} \\item[Estimator $\\Alg_1$:] Let $W = \\sum_{i\\in U}w_i$. Sample person $i$ with probability $\\frac{w_i}{W}$ and output $W$  if $i$ prefers fondue and $0$  otherwise. \\item[Estimator $\\Alg_2$:] Sample person $i$ with probability $\\frac{1}{|U|}$ and output $|U| \\cdot w_i$  if $i$ prefers fondue and $0$  otherwise. \\end{description} Let $X_1$ and $X_2$ be the random outputs of $\\Alg_1$ and $\\Alg_2$, respectively.

        "answer": "It is easy to see that if a bipartite graph has a perfect matching, then  $|S| \\leq |N(S)|$ for all $S\\subseteq A$. This holds even if we only consider the edges inside the perfect matching. Now we focus on proving the other direction, i.e., if $|S| \\leq |N(S)|$ for all $S\\subseteq A$ then $G$ has a perfect matching. We define a procedure that given a matching $M$ with maximum size which does not cover $a_0 \\in A$, it returns a set $S \\subseteq  A$ such that $|N(S)| < |S|$. This shows that the size of the matching should be $n$. To this end, let $A_0 = \\{a_0\\}$ and $B_0 = N(a_0)$. Note that all vertices of $B_0$ are covered by the matching $M$ (if $b_0 \\in B_0$ is not covered, the edge $a_0b_0$ can be added to the matching which contradicts the fact that $M$ is a maximum matching). If $B_0 = \\emptyset$, $S = A_0$ is a set such that $|N(S)| < |S|$. Else, $B_0$ is matched with $|B_0|$ vertices of $A$ distinct from $a_0$. We set $A_1 = N_M(B_0)\\cup\\{a_0\\}$, where $N_M(B_0)$ is the set of vertices matched with vertices of $B_0$. We have $|A_1| = |B_0|+1 \\geq |A_0|+1$. Let $B_1 = N(A_1)$. Again, no vertices in $B_1$ is exposed, otherwise there is an augmenting path. If $|B_1| < |A_1|$, the algorithm terminates with $|N(A_1)| < |A_1|$. If not, let $A_2 = N_M(B_1)\\cup\\{a_0\\}$. Then $|A_2| \\geq |B_1| + 1 \\geq |A_1| + 1$. We continue this procedure till it terminates. This procedure eventually terminates since size of set $A_i$ is strictly increasing. Hence it return a set $S\\subseteq A$ such that $|N(A)| < |S|$.\t\\footnote{Some parts of this proof are taken from this \\href{http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Frederic.Havet/Cours/matching.pdf}{link}. }",

First observe that if the summation of the $t_i$ for $1 \\leq i \\leq k$ is not equal to $n-1$ then there is no feasible solution since we know that the number of edge in any spanning tree is exactly $n-1$. Therefore, we assume $\\sum_{1 \\leq i \\leq k} t_i = n-1$. The ground set for both matroids that we use is the set of the edges $E$. First matroid that we use is the graphic matroid. The second matroid that we use is a partition matroid with following independent sets: \\[ \\mathcal{I} = \\{ F \\subseteq E \\text{ }| \\text{ } |F\\cap E_i| \\leq t_i, \\quad \\text{for } 1 \\leq i \\leq k\\} \\] As shown in class the both above defined matroids are indeed matroid. Now assume that $F$ is the maximum size independent set the intersection of these two matroids (we saw in the class how we can find $F$).  If $|F| < n-1$ it is not possible to find a solution for our problem, since any solution to our problem corresponds to a solution in the intersection of these two matroids of size $n-1$. Moreover, if $|F| = n-1$, than $F$ is a spanning tree and $|F\\cap E_i| \\leq t_i$. Also, we know that $|F| = n-1$ and $\\sum_{1 \\leq i \\leq k} t_i = n-1$ and $E_i$'s are disjoint.

        "answer": "Let $i^*$ be the weight of a minimum-weight perfect matching (and so $\\mathcal{M}_{i^*}$ contains all perfect matchings of minimum weight). We first prove that \\begin{align} \\label{eq:prob} \\Pr[f_{i^*}(p)= 0] \\leq 1/n\\,, \\end{align} where the probability is over the random selection of $p(e)$'s in Step 2 of the algorithm. First note that if we think of $f_{i^*}(x)$ as a polynomial in the variables $x(e)$ for each edge $e\\in E$ (that are replaced by the values $p(e)$), then we have that $f_{i^*}(x)$ is not identical to zero since $\\mathcal{M}_{i^*} \\neq \\emptyset$ and the monomial $\\prod_{e\\in M} x(e)$ corresponding to a matching $M\\in \\mathcal{M}_{i^*}$ appears only once (with a non-zero coefficient) in $f_{i^*}(p)$.   The probability bound~\\eqref{eq:prob} now follows from the Schwartz-Zippel lemma that we saw in class since each $p(e)$ is selected from a set of $n^2$ values at random and the degree of $f_{i^*}$ is $n$. We now prove that the algorithm \\emph{always} outputs the correct answer if $f_{i^*}(p) \\neq 0$ (and hence with probability at least $1-1/n$ over the selection of $p(e)$'s). First note that $2^{i^* n^{100}}$ divides $\\det(A)$, since for $i < i^*$ we have $f_i(x) = 0$ (in particular, $f_i(p) = 0$) because $i^*$ is the value of a min-weight perfect matching and so $\\mathcal{M}_i = \\emptyset$, and all $f_i(p)$ (for all $i$) are integers, therefore \\begin{align*} \\det(A) = \\sum_{i=0}^\\infty 2^{i\\cdot n^{100}} f_i(p) = \\sum_{i=i^*}^\\infty 2^{i\\cdot n^{100}} f_i(p) \\end{align*} is divisible by $2^{i^* \\cdot n^{100}}$. We have thus proved that the algorithm outputs an integer that is at least $i^*$. We now show that if $f_{i^*}(p) \\neq 0$, then $2^{(i^* +1)n^{100}}$ does not divide $\\det(A)$ and thus the algorithm must output the correct value. To do so, we bound the absolute value of $f_{i^*}(p)$. We have \\begin{align*} |f_{i^*}(p)| = \\left|\\sum_{M \\in \\mathcal{M}_i} \\textrm{sign}(M) \\prod_{e\\in M} p(e)\\right| \\leq \\sum_{M \\in \\mathcal{M}_{i^*}}  \\prod_{e\\in M} p(e) \\leq |\\mathcal{M}_{i^*}| \\prod_{e\\in M}n^2 \\leq n! \\cdot (n^2)^n \\leq n^{3n} < 2^{n^{100}}\\,. \\end{align*} Therefore \\begin{align*} \\left|2^{i^*\\cdot n^{100}}f_{i^*}(p)\\right| < 2^{i^* \\cdot n^{100}} 2^{n^{100}} = 2^{(i^*+1) \\cdot n^{100}} \\end{align*} but $2^{i^*\\cdot n^{100}}f_{i^*}(p) \\ne 0$, and so $2^{(i^*+1) n^{100}}$ does not divide $2^{i^*\\cdot n^{100}}f_{i^*}(p)$, whereas it does divide $2^{i \\cdot n^{100}}f_{i}(p)$ for all $i > i^*$.

Let $X_i$ be a random variable corresponding to the event whether i-th element is covered by the output $C$ or not. Specifically, let $X_i = 1$ if the given constraint is not satisfied (therefore given element is not covered) and $X_i = 0$ if it is satisfied (therefore the element is covered) after $d$ executions of Step 3. Let $X$ denote the total number of constraints that are not satisfied. Therefore we write, $$X = X_1 + X_2 + \\dots + X_n.$$ From Claim~9 in the Lecture 7 notes, we know that the probability that a constraint remains unsatisfied after a single execution of Step 3 is at most $\\frac{1}{e}$. In addition, from the first step in the proof of Claim~10, the probability that a constraint is unsatisfied after $d$ executions of Step 3 is at most $\\frac{1}{e^d}$. In other words, we have in our notation that $$\\mathbb{P}(X_i = 1) \\leq \\frac{1}{e^d}.$$ Since each $X_i$ is a Bernoulli random variable, we can write their expectation as $$\\mathbb{E}(X_i) \\leq \\frac{1}{e^d}.$$ We want to bound the probability that more than 10 \\% of the elements are not covered (which also means less than 90 \\% of the elements are covered). We can use Markov's Inequality to write, \\begin{align*} \\mathbb{P}\\left(X \\geq \\frac{n}{10}\\right) &\\leq \\frac{\\mathbb{E}(X)}{n/10}\\\\ &= \\frac{\\mathbb{E}(X_1) + \\mathbb{E}(X_2) + \\dots + \\mathbb{E}(X_n)}{n/10} \\\\ &\\leq \\frac{n \\cdot \\frac{1}{e^d}}{n/10} \\\\ &= \\frac{10}{e^d}. \\end{align*} Lastly, similar to Claim 11 in the lecture notes, we will bound the probability of bad events (namely, the cost is high or less than 90 \\% of elements are covered). Firstly, we found that expected cost after $d$ executions is at most $d\\cdot LP_{OPT}$. We can write using Markov's Inequality that, $$\\mathbb{P}(cost \\geq 5d\\cdot LP_{OPT}) \\leq \\frac{1}{5}.$$ Secondly, we bound the probability of event that less than 90 \\% of elements are covered. We did it above and showed that probability that more than 10 \\% of the elements are not covered is at most $\\frac{10}{e^d}$. In the worst case, these bad events are completely disjoint. Therefore, the probability that no bad event occurs is at least $1 - \\frac{1}{5} - \\frac{10}{e^d} > \\frac{1}{2}$ for some large constant $d$. Therefore, the algorithm, with probability at least $\\frac{1}{2}$, will return a collection of sets that cover at least 90 \\% of the elements and has cost at most $5d LP_{OPT} \\leq 5d \\mbox{OPT}$.",

Then \\begin{align*} 1 = y_{\\{u,v\\}} = |0 - 1| = |x_u - x_v|\\,. \\end{align*} \\item If $\\{u,v\\} \\not \\in \\delta(S)$ then either $x_u =x_v = 0$ (both are in $S$) or $x_u =x_v$ (both are outside $S$). In either case $|x_u -x_v| = 0$ and so the constraint $ y_{\\{u,v\\}}  = 0 = |x_u - x_v|$ is again verified (with equality). \\end{itemize} \\item $x_s = 0$ and  $x_t = 1$. Moreover, we have $x_v \\in \\{0,1\\} \\subseteq [0,1]$ for every $v\\in V$. \\end{itemize} This finishes one part of the proof - there is an assignment to the variables such that the LP outputs $OPT$. This means that $OPT_{LP}$ is at most $OPT$, in other words $OPT_{LP} \\leq OPT$.\\\\ Now let's prove that $OPT_{LP} \\geq OPT$. Suppose that $(\\{x^*_v\\}_{v\\in V},\\{y^*_e\\}_{e\\in E})$ is an optimal solution to the LP. Consider the following randomized rounding: select $\\theta \\in (0,1)$ uniformly at random and let $S = S_\\theta= \\{v\\in V: x^*_v \\leq \\theta\\}$. Let's analyze this rounding algorithm. It is clear that we always output a feasible cut since $x^*_s = 0$ and $x^*_t =1$. This tells us that for every $\\theta\\in (0,1)$ the associated $S_\\theta$ is a valid solution and so $OPT \\leq \\delta(S_\\theta)$. We thus have \\begin{align*} OPT \\leq \\mathbb{E}_{\\theta \\in [0,1]} [|\\delta(\\{v: x^*_v \\leq \\theta\\}|)]. \\end{align*} We will now complete the proof by showing that the above expectation is at most $OPT_{LP}$. Let's introduce a new random variable $X_{e,\\theta}$ that indicates if an edge is cut: $$X_{e,\\theta} = \\begin{cases} 1&\\mbox{ if $e\\in \\delta(S_\\theta)$} \\\\ 0 & \\mbox{otherwise}. \\end{cases}$$ Then the expectation above equals $$          \\mathbb{E}_{\\theta \\in [0,1]} \\left[ \\sum_{e\\in E} X_{e,\\theta} \\right]=  \\sum_{e\\in E}\\mathbb{E}_{\\theta \\in [0,1]}  \\left[ X_{e,\\theta} \\right] $$ Let's analyze $\\mathbb{E}_{\\theta \\in [0,1]}  \\left[ X_e \\right] = \\Pr_{\\theta \\in [0,1]}[e \\text{ is cut in } S_\\theta]$ for a specific edge $e=\\{u,v\\}\\in E$. In the case when $x^*_u \\leq x^*_v$, the edge $e$ is cut if and only if $x^*_u \\leq \\theta  \\leq x^*_v$. The other case is analogous. It follows that \\begin{align*} \\Pr_{\\theta \\in [0,1]}[X_{\\{u,v\\},\\theta}] = \\begin{cases} \\Pr_{\\theta \\in [0,1]}[ \\theta \\in [x^*_u, x^*_v]] & \\mbox{if $x^*_u \\leq x^*_v$}\\\\ \\Pr_{\\theta \\in [0,1]}[ \\theta \\in [x^*_v, x^*_u]] & \\mbox{if $x^*_u > x^*_v$} \\end{cases} = |x^*_u - x^*_v|\\,. \\end{align*} Now since the LP guarantees that $y^*_{\\{u,v\\}} \\geq |x_u^* - x_v^*|$, we have \\begin{align*} \\sum_{\\{u,v\\}\\in E}\\mathbb{E}_{\\theta \\in [0,1]}  \\left[ X_{\\{u,v\\},\\theta} \\right] =  \\sum_{\\{u,v\\}\\in E}|x^*_u - x^*_v| \\leq \\sum_{\\{u,v\\}\\in E} y^*_{\\{u,v\\}} =  OPT_{LP}\\,. \\end{align*} It follows that $$ OPT \\leq  \\mathbb{E}_{\\theta \\in [0,1]} [|\\delta(\\{v: x^*_v \\leq \\theta\\}|)] \\leq OPT_{LP} $$ and this finishes the proof.",

If $e \\in A'$, we assign weight $w_e=n^2+1$ to it, otherwise we set $w_e=n^2$. Let $\\delta^{+}(v)=\\{u\\in V : (v,u) \\in E'\\}$ denote the set of outgoing edges of $v$ in $G'$ and   $\\delta^{-}(v)=\\{u\\in V : (u,v) \\in E'\\}$ be the set of incoming edges of $v$ in $G'$. With the arc set $E'$ as ground set we define two partition matroids $\\mathcal{M}_1$ and $\\mathcal{M}_2$: \\begin{itemize} \\item To be independent in $\\mathcal{M}_1$ one can take at most one of $\\{(u,v), (v,u)\\}$ for every $\\{u,v\\} \\in E$, i.e., \\begin{align*} \\mathcal{I}_1 = \\{F \\subseteq E': |F \\cap \\{(u,v), (v,u)\\} | \\leq 1\\mbox{ for all $\\{u,v\\}\\in E$}\\}\\,. \\end{align*} This matroid enforces the constraint that each edge should be oriented in one direction. \\item To be independent in $M_2$, one can take at most $\\frac{1}{2}\\text{deg}(v)$ arcs among the set $\\delta^{+}(v)$  of outgoing arcs for every $v$: \\begin{align*} \\mathcal{I}_2 = \\{F \\subseteq E': |F \\cap \\delta^+(v)| \\leq \\frac{1}{2}\\text{deg}(v) \\mbox{, for all $v\\in V$}\\}\\,. \\end{align*} \\end{itemize} Let solution $S$ be the maximum weight independent set  in the intersection of the two matroids  $\\mathcal{M}_1$, and  $\\mathcal{M}_2$. Now we prove that a solution $S$ is feasible if and only if it is independent in both $\\mathcal{I}_1$ and $\\mathcal{I}_2$. First observe that any solution with maximum weight, also has the maximum cardinality. Every solution of size $k$ has weight at most $k\\cdot (n^2+1)$, whereas any solution of size $k+1$ has weight at least $(k+1)n^2$ which is larger than any solution of size at most $k$. Thus the maximum weighted solution has maximum size i.e. $|A'|$. Now we prove that any solution (with maximum cardinality) that is independent in $\\mathcal{I}_2$, satisfies both indegree and outdegree constraints. Suppose $F \\subseteq \\mathcal{I}_2$ and $|F|=|A'|$. Thus we have \\[|A'|=\\sum_{v \\in V} |F \\cap \\delta^+(v)| \\leq \\sum_{v \\in V} \\frac{1}{2}\\text{deg}(v) = |A'| \\text{.}\\] Thus for all $v \\in V$, we have  $|F \\cap \\delta^+(v)| = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{deg}(v)$, so that $|F \\cap \\delta^-(v)| = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{deg}(v)$. Thus $F$ is a feasible solution to the problem. Recall that solution $S$ has the maximum weight among all feasible solutions. Thus $S$ has maximum cardinality, and among all the feasible solutions with the same cardinality, $S$ maximizes $|E'\\cap A'|$. By Edmonds, Lawler's theorem, there is a polynomial-time algorithm for finding a maximum weight independent set in the intersection of two matroids $\\mathcal{M}_1$, and  $\\mathcal{M}_2$.",

Therefore, a spinning nucleus acts as a tiny bar magnet oriented along the spin rotation axis. This tiny magnet is often called a nuclear spin. If we put this small magnet in the field of a much larger magnet, its orientation will no longer be random. There will be one most probable orientation. However, if the tiny magnet is oriented precisely 180° in the opposite direction, that position could also be maintained. In scientific jargon the most favorable orientation would be the low-energy state and the less favorable orientation the high-energy state.This two-state description is appropriate for most nuclei of biologic interest which have nuclear spin quantum number \\(I = 1/2\\). It is a quantum mechanical requirement that any individual nuclear spins of a nucleus with \\(I = 1/2\\) be in one of the two states (and nothing in between) whenever the nuclei are in a magnetic field.

At the neuromuscular junction, the neurotransmitter acetylcholine activates postsynaptic ligand-gated ion channels, which are called nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. This causes an influx of cations, most importantly sodium ions, which in turn causes a postsynaptic depolarization of the muscle. The muscle gets depolarized and fires an action potential, which propagates along the muscle cell and throughout the complex membrane invaginations of the T-tubules. The depolarisation activates voltage-gated calcium channels, which signal through a protein-protein interaction with ryanodine receptors to activate calcium release from intracellular calcium stores (the sarcoplasmic reticulum).",

        "explanation": "A large amount of glutamatergic input in the striatum comes from the neocortex. Dopamine seems to have two opposing actions on cortical input to the striatum. The action of dopamine in the context of the glutamatergic synapses is on the D1 receptors to promote the insertion of both AMPA and NMDA receptors onto the postsynaptic membranes. D1 receptor activation appears to be essential for promoting long-term potentiation, and cortical input onto the D1 striatal projection neurons appears to be potentiated by the action of dopamine. Therefore, a strengthening of the direct pathway occurs in the presence of reward. On the other hand, the activation of D2 receptors from dopamine seems to be involved in the opposite type of synaptic plasticity. In particular, activation of D2 receptors prevents calcium entry through the NMDA receptor, inducing long-term depression at the synapse. Thus, dopamine acting upon D2 receptors suppresses cortical input to the striatum and gives rise to long-term depression onto the indirect striatal projection neurons.",

        "answer": "We want to assign each job to a machine. For any job $j$ which the LP assigns to a single machine $i$, i.e., $x^*_{ij} = 1$, it clearly makes sense to listen to the LP and assign $j$ to $i$. To assign the other jobs, we will use the graph $H$, which has the following properties: \\begin{itemize} \\item $H$ is acyclic, i.e., a forest. \\item Vertices corresponding to the already-assigned jobs are isolated. \\item Vertices corresponding to the yet-unassigned jobs have degree at least two. \\end{itemize} While $H$ contains an edge, we iteratively do the following: \\begin{itemize} \\item Choose a machine $i$ whose vertex $a_i$ has degree one in $H$, i.e., there is only a single edge $\\{a_i, b_j\\}$ incident to $a_i$. (Such a machine exists because $H$ is nonempty, and a nonempty forest contains a degree-one vertex; since job-vertices have degrees either zero or at least two, a degree-one vertex must be a machine-vertex.) \\item Assign job $j$ to machine $i$. \\item Remove all edges incident to $j$ from $H$. (Note that this preserves all the above properties of $H$.) \\end{itemize} Obviously, this procedure will terminate. Note that it will assign all jobs to machines, because as long as there is an unassigned job $j$, the vertex $b_j$ has at least two incident edges in $H$. It remains to reason that for every machine $i$, the sum of processing times of jobs assigned to $i$ (this is called the \\textit{makespan} of $i$) is at most $T + \\max_{j \\in J} p_j$. This is because there are two kinds of jobs assigned to $i$: \\begin{itemize} \\item Assigned in the beginning: the jobs $j$ which had $x^*_{ij} = 1$. The total processing time of these jobs is \\[ \\sum_{j\\in J: x^*_{ij} = 1} p_j = \\sum_{j\\in J: x^*_{ij} = 1} x^*_{ij} p_j \\le \\sum_{j\\in J: i \\in N(j)} x^*_{ij} p_j \\le T. \\] \\item Assigned later: at most one other job. For note that we only assign a job to $i$ when $a_i$ is of degree-one, and once we do, $a_i$ becomes isolated and no more jobs can be assigned to $i$. This job has processing time at most $\\max_{j \\in J} p_j$. \\end{itemize} Another perspective on the solution is the following. By looking at the makespan bound $T + \\max_j p_j$ that we should satisfy, we can notice that it will be fine if we assign the integral jobs to the machines that the LP has selected and the non-integral jobs in such a way that each machine gets at most one. In other words, we just need to prove that the graph $H$ has a matching which matches all non-integral jobs (any such matching will be fine). Our iterative procedure is one way to prove that such a matching exists.",
        "question": "In this problem we are going to investigate the linear programming relaxation of a classical scheduling problem. In the considered problem, we are given a set $M$ of $m$ machines and a set $J$ of $n$ jobs. Each job $j\\in J$ has a processing time $p_j > 0$ and can be processed on a subset $N(j) \\subseteq M$ of the machines.  The goal is to assign each job $j$ to a machine in $N(j)$ so as to complete all the jobs by a given deadline $T$. (Each machine can only process one job at a time.) If we, for $j\\in J$ and $i\\in N(j)$, let $x_{ij}$ denote the indicator variable indicating that $j$ was assigned to $i$, then we can formulate the scheduling problem as the following integer linear program: \\begin{align*} \\sum_{i\\in N(j)} x_{ij} & = 1 \\qquad \\mbox{for all }  j\\in J & \\hspace{-3em} \\mbox{\\small \\emph{(Each job $j$ should be assigned to a machine $i\\in N(j)$)}} \\\\ \\sum_{j\\in J: i \\in N(j)} x_{ij} p_j & \\leq T \\qquad \\mbox{for all } i \\in M & \\hspace{-3em} \\mbox{\\small \\emph{(Time needed to process jobs assigned to $i$ should be $\\leq T$)}} \\\\ x_{ij} &\\in \\{0,1\\}   \\  \\mbox{for all } j\\in J, \\ i \\in N(j) \\end{align*} The above integer linear program  is NP-hard to solve, but we can obtain a linear programming relaxation by relaxing the constraints $x_{ij} \\in \\{0,1\\}$ to $x_{ij} \\in [0,1]$. The obtained linear program can be solved in polynomial time using e.g. the ellipsoid method. \\\\[2mm] \\emph{Example.} An example is as follows. We have two machines $M = \\{m_1, m_2\\}$ and three jobs $J= \\{j_1, j_2, j_3\\}$. Job $j_1$ has processing time $1/2$ and can only be assigned to $m_1$;  job $j_2$ has processing time $1/2$ and can only be assigned to $m_2$; and job $j_3$ has processing time $1$ and can be assigned to either machine. Finally, we have the ``deadline'' $T=1$. An extreme point solution to the linear programming relaxation is $x^*_{11} = 1, x^*_{22} =1, x^*_{13} = 1/2$ and $x^*_{23} = 1/2$. The associated graph $H$ (defined in subproblem~\\textbf{a}) can be illustrated as follows: \\begin{tikzpicture} \\node[vertex] (a1) at (0,1.7) {$a_1$}; \\node[vertex] (a2) at (0,0.3) {$a_2$}; \\node[vertex] (b1) at (3,2.5) {$b_1$}; \\node[vertex] (b2) at (3,1) {$b_2$}; \\node[vertex] (b3) at (3,-0.5) {$b_3$}; \\draw (a1) edge (b3); \\draw (a2) edge (b3); \\end{tikzpicture} Use the structural result proved in the first subproblem to devise an efficient rounding algorithm that, given an instance and a feasible extreme point $x^*$ in the linear programming relaxation corresponding to the instance, returns a schedule that completes all jobs by deadline $T + \\max_{j\\in J} p_j$. In other words, you wish to assign jobs to machines so that the total processing time of the jobs a machine receives is at most $T + \\max_{j\\in J} p_j$.",

In fact, consider two writers W1 and W2. W1 is a more active writer than W2. Assume W1 has already written 10 times to the register (t1 = 10). After that, W2 writes for the first time to the register, its local timestamp will then be less than 10 (t2 = 1).

        "answer": "Here we give a detailed explanation of how to set the costs. Your solution does not need to contain such a detailed explanation. The idea of using the Hedge method for linear programming is to associate an expert with each constraint of the LP. In other words, the Hedge method will maintain a weight distribution over the set of constraints of a linear problem to solve, and to iteratively update those weights in a multiplicative manner based on the cost function at each step. Initially, the Hedge method will give a weight $w^{(1)}_i = 1$ for every constraint/expert $i=1,\\dots, m$ (the number $m$ of constraints now equals the number of experts).   And at each step $t$, it will maintain a convex combination $\\vec{p}^{(t)}$ of the constraints (that is defined in terms of the weights). Using such a convex combination $\\vec{p}$,  a natural easier LP with a single constraint is obtained  by summing up all the constraints according to $\\vec{p}$.   Any optimal solution of the original LP is also a solution of this reduced problem, so the new problem will have at least the same cost as the previous one. We define an oracle for solving this reduced problem: \\begin{definition}{} An oracle that, given $\\vec{p} = (p_1, \\dots, p_m) \\geq \\mathbf{0}$ such that $\\sum_{i=1}^m p_i = 1$, outputs an optimal solution $x^*$ to the following reduced linear problem: \\begin{align*} \\textbf{Maximize} \\hspace{0.8cm} & \\sum_{j=1}^n c_jx_j  \\\\ \\textbf{subject to}\\hspace{0.8cm} &\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^m p_i A_i \\right) \\cdot x \\leq \\sum_{i=1}^m p_ib_i  \\\\ \\hspace{0.8cm} &  x \\geq 0 \\\\ \\end{align*} \\end{definition} As explained, we associate an expert to each constraint of the covering LP. In addition, we wish to increase the weight of unsatisfied constraints and decrease the weight of satisfied constraints (in a smooth manner depending on the size of the violation or the slack). The Hedge algorithm for covering LPs thus becomes: \\begin{itemize} \\item Assign each constraint $i$ a weight $w_i^{(1)}$ initialized to $1$. \\end{itemize} At each time $t$: \\begin{itemize} \\item Pick the distribution  $p^{(t)}_i = w_i^{(t)}/\\Phi^{(t)}$ where $\\Phi^{(t)}= \\sum_{i\\in [N]} w^{(t)}_i$. \\item  Now \\emph{we define the cost vector instead of the adversary} as follows: \\begin{itemize} \\item Let $x^{(t)}$ be the solution returned by the oracle on the LP obtained by using the convex combination $\\vec{p}^{(t)}$ of constraints. Notice that cost of $x^{(t)}$, i.e., $c^\\top x^{(t)}$, is at least the cost of an optimal solution to the original LP. \\item Define the cost of constraint $i$ as \\begin{align*} m^{(t)}_i = b_i -\\sum_{j=1}^n A_{ij} x_j  =  b_i - A_i x . \\end{align*} Notice that we have a positive cost  if the constraint is satisfied (so the weight will be decreased by Hedge) and a negative cost if it is violated (so the weight will be increased by Hedge). \\end{itemize} \\item After observing the cost vector, set $w_i^{(t+1)} = w_i^{(t)} \\cdot e^{-\\varepsilon \\cdot m_i^{(t)}}$. \\end{itemize} {\\bf Output:} the average $\\bar x =\\frac{1}{T} \\sum_{t=1}^T x^{(t)}$ of the constructed solutions.",

        "answer": "Instead of selecting the edge to contract in each iteration uniformly at random. Now select an edge proportional to its weight $w_e$. To show that this idea indeed makes sense, we observe that Claim 1 from the notes of Lecture~11 still holds: the probability that we select an edge in $E(S^*, \\overline{S^*})$ to contract is at most $2/n$. Indeed, let $k= \\sum_{e\\in E(S^*, \\overline{S^*})} w(e)$ be the weight of the min cut and $w(E) = \\sum_{e\\in E} w(e)$ denotes the total weight of the edges. The probability that we select an edge in the min cut $E(S^*, \\overline{S^*})$ is $$ P[e\\in E(S^*,\\overline{S^*})] =\\frac{k}{w(E)}$$ Now similar to the hand-shake lemma we have $$ \\sum_{v\\in V} w(\\delta(v)) = 2\\cdot w(E) $$ where $\\delta(v)$ denotes the edges adjacent to $v$ and $w(\\delta(v))$ is the weight of $\\delta(v)$. We also have that $$ w(\\delta(v)) \\geq k $$ since $k$ is the weight of the mincut. Therefore, \\begin{align*} \\sum_{v\\in V} w(\\delta(v)) = 2\\cdot w(E) \\geq k\\cdot n \\Rightarrow w(E) \\geq k\\cdot n/2\\,. \\end{align*} This means $$P[e\\in E(S^*,\\overline{S^*})] =\\frac{k}{w(E)} \\leq \\frac{k}{nk/2} =\\frac{2}{n} $$ Hence, we have that the probability to contract an edge in $E(S^*, \\overline{S^*})$ is at most $2/n$. The analysis now continues in the exact same manner as in the unweighted case. We observe that even in a weighted graph, when we contract an edge $(u, v)$ the size of the minimum cut does not decrease. Then, let, $A_{i}$  be the event that the edge picked in step $i$ of the loop is not in $E(S^*,\\overline{S^*})$. We need to lower bound $P[A_1,A_2,\\dots,A_{n-2}]$. By Bayes rule we have, \\begin{eqnarray*} P[A_1,\\dots,A_{n-2}] = P[A_{1}] P[A_{2}|A_{1}] P[A_{3}|A_{1},A_{2}] \\dots P[A_{n-2}|A_{1},A_{2},\\dots,A_{n-3}]. \\end{eqnarray*} From the above, we have that, for all $i$, $$ P[A_i | A_1,\\dots,A_{i-1}] \\geq 1- \\frac{2}{n-i+1}.$$ Therefore, \\begin{eqnarray*} P[A_1,\\dots,A_{n-2}] &\\geq &  \\left(1-\\frac{2}{n}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{2}{n-1}\\right)\\dots \\left(1-\\frac{2}{3}\\right)\\\\ &=& \\frac{n-2}{n}\\cdot \\frac{n-3}{n-1}\\cdot \\frac{n-4}{n-2}\\dots \\frac{1}{3}\\\\ &=&\\frac{2}{n(n-1)}=1/{n\\choose 2}. \\end{eqnarray*}",

        "answer": "Suppose that $H$ contains a (simple) cycle. As usual, we will show that $x^*$ can then be written as a convex combination of two different feasible points, contradicting that $x^*$ is an extreme point. Namely, we will define a nonzero vector $y$ such that $x - \\epsilon y$ and $x + \\epsilon y$ are both feasible (for a small enough $\\epsilon > 0$). Of course, $x = \\frac{(x - \\epsilon y) + (x + \\epsilon y)}{2}$. As in the proof for the bipartite matching polytope, label edges in the cycle alternately as odd and even. In that proof, we defined $y$ to be $+1$ on even edges and $-1$ on odd edges, but this doesn't quite work here. This is because of the constraints $\\sum_{j\\in J: i \\in N(j)} x_{ij} p_j  \\leq T$: the left-hand side would change when adding $y$ because the $p_j$'s are different.\\footnote{ It is not enough to set $\\epsilon$ small enough.

Then: \\begin{itemize} \\item for each $j \\in J$ we have $\\sum_{i \\in N(j)} y_{ij} = 0$ because this sum has two nonzero terms, equal to $1/p_j$ and $-1/p_j$ (or no nonzero terms if $j$ does not appear in the cycle), \\item for each $i \\in M$ we have $\\sum_{j\\in J: i \\in N(j)} y_{ij} p_j = 0$ because this sum has two nonzero terms, equal to $1/p_j \\cdot p_j$ and $-1/p_{j'} \\cdot p_{j'}$ where $j$ and $j'$ are the neighbors of $i$ on the cycle (or no nonzero terms if $i$ does not appear in the cycle), \\item since $y_{ij} \\ne 0$ only if $0 < x^*_{ij} < 1$, we can set $\\epsilon$ so that $0 \\le x^*_{ij} \\pm \\epsilon y_{ij} \\le 1$ for all $i$ and $j$. \\end{itemize} This shows that the points $x \\pm \\epsilon y$ are both feasible. \\newpage",
        "question": "In this problem we are going to investigate the linear programming relaxation of a classical scheduling problem. In the considered problem, we are given a set $M$ of $m$ machines and a set $J$ of $n$ jobs. Each job $j\\in J$ has a processing time $p_j > 0$ and can be processed on a subset $N(j) \\subseteq M$ of the machines.  The goal is to assign each job $j$ to a machine in $N(j)$ so as to complete all the jobs by a given deadline $T$. (Each machine can only process one job at a time.) If we, for $j\\in J$ and $i\\in N(j)$, let $x_{ij}$ denote the indicator variable indicating that $j$ was assigned to $i$, then we can formulate the scheduling problem as the following integer linear program: \\begin{align*} \\sum_{i\\in N(j)} x_{ij} & = 1 \\qquad \\mbox{for all }  j\\in J & \\hspace{-3em} \\mbox{\\small \\emph{(Each job $j$ should be assigned to a machine $i\\in N(j)$)}} \\\\ \\sum_{j\\in J: i \\in N(j)} x_{ij} p_j & \\leq T \\qquad \\mbox{for all } i \\in M & \\hspace{-3em} \\mbox{\\small \\emph{(Time needed to process jobs assigned to $i$ should be $\\leq T$)}} \\\\ x_{ij} &\\in \\{0,1\\}   \\  \\mbox{for all } j\\in J, \\ i \\in N(j) \\end{align*} The above integer linear program  is NP-hard to solve, but we can obtain a linear programming relaxation by relaxing the constraints $x_{ij} \\in \\{0,1\\}$ to $x_{ij} \\in [0,1]$. The obtained linear program can be solved in polynomial time using e.g. the ellipsoid method. \\\\[2mm] \\emph{Example.} An example is as follows. We have two machines $M = \\{m_1, m_2\\}$ and three jobs $J= \\{j_1, j_2, j_3\\}$. Job $j_1$ has processing time $1/2$ and can only be assigned to $m_1$;  job $j_2$ has processing time $1/2$ and can only be assigned to $m_2$; and job $j_3$ has processing time $1$ and can be assigned to either machine. Finally, we have the ``deadline'' $T=1$. An extreme point solution to the linear programming relaxation is $x^*_{11} = 1, x^*_{22} =1, x^*_{13} = 1/2$ and $x^*_{23} = 1/2$.

        "answer": "Let $y$ be an optimal solution to the linear program of value $\\optlp$. We shall give a randomized rounding that outputs an $s,t$-cut that in expectation cuts $\\optlp$ edges. Since any cut must cut at least $\\opt$ edges, it then follows that $\\optlp \\geq \\opt$. We now describe the rounding procedure. For each vertex $v\\in V$, define \\begin{align*} x_v = \\mbox{the length of the shortest path from $s$ to $v$ in the graph where edge $e\\in E$ has length $y_e$.} \\end{align*} Notice that $x_s  =0$ and $x_t \\geq 1$. That $x_t\\geq 1$ is due to the fact that for every path $p\\in P$ from $s$ to $t$ we have $\\sum_{e\\in p} y_e \\geq 1$.  Furthermore, the variables $x$ satisfy the following key property: \\begin{claim} For every edge $\\{u,v\\} \\in E$, we have $y_{\\{u,v\\}} \\geq |x_v- x_u|$. \\label{claim:2} \\end{claim} \\begin{proof} Name the vertices so that $x_v > x_u$ and suppose toward contradiction that $y_{\\{u,v\\}} < x_v - x_u$. Let $p_u$ be a shortest path from $s$ to $u$ that has length $x_u$. And consider the path $p_u + \\{u,v\\}$. This is a path from $s$ to $v$ that has length $x_u + y_{\\{u,v\\}}$, which is strictly smaller than $x_v$ (contradicting the definition of $x_v$ to be the length of a \\emph{shortest} path). \\end{proof} We can thus deduce that we have a feasible solution to the linear program: \\begin{equation*} \\begin{array}{ll@{}ll} \\text{minimize}  & & \\displaystyle\\sum_{e \\in E} y_e &\\\\ \\text{subject to}& & \\displaystyle\\sum_{e \\in p} y_{\\{u,v\\}} \\geq x_u - x_v, \\quad \\mbox{for every $\\{u,v\\} \\in E$}\\\\ & & \\displaystyle\\sum_{e \\in p} y_{\\{u,v\\}} \\geq x_v - x_u, \\quad \\mbox{for every $\\{u,v\\} \\in E$}\\\\ & & x_s = 0, x_t \\geq 1,\\\\ & & x_v \\ge 0,  \\forall v \\in V \\\\ & & y_e \\ge 0  \\forall e \\in E. \\end{array} \\end{equation*} In class, we saw that the above linear program has cost equal to $\\opt$ which finishes the proof. For completeness, we give the full argument. The rounding algorithm is as follows: \\begin{itemize} \\item Select $\\theta \\in[0,1]$ uniformly at random. \\item Output $S = \\{v\\in V: x_v < \\theta \\}$. \\end{itemize} Notice that $S$ always contains $s$ (since $x_s = 0$) and never contains $t$ (since $x_t \\geq 1$). We now analyze the expected number of edges that are cut. Let $X_e$ be the random indicator variable for the event that edge $e$ is cut. Then \\begin{align*} \\E_\\theta[\\mbox{\\# edges cut}] = \\E_\\theta\\left[\\sum_{e\\in E} X_e \\right] = \\sum_{e\\in E} \\E_\\theta[X_e] = \\sum_{e\\in E} \\Pr_\\theta[\\mbox{e is cut}]\\,. \\end{align*} We now analyze, for a fixed edge $e=\\{u,v\\} \\in E$, the probability that $e$ is cut over the uniformly at random choice $\\theta \\in [0,1]$. Assume without loss of generality that $x_u < x_v$. We then have that $e$ is cut if and only if $\\theta \\in [x_u, x_v]$ which happens with probability at most $x_v - x_u$ (we say at most because $x_v$ could, in theory, be bigger than $1$). Now, by Claim~\\ref{claim:2} above, $x_v -x_u \\leq y_e$. So we have \\[\\opt \\leq \\E_\\theta[\\mbox{\\# edges cut}] \\leq \\sum_{e\\in E} y_e= \\optlp\\,,\\] as required.",

Consider the LP for bipartite perfect matching on $G_0$. The LP is feasible because setting $x_e = 1/k$ for all $e \\in E$ satisfies all the constraints (recall that each vertex of a $k$-regular graph is incident to exactly $k$ edges). Now we find an extreme point solution to the LP in polynomial time, and due to the integrality of such solutions, we get a valid perfect matching $M_1$. Notice that $M_1$, being a perfect matching, forms a $1$-regular sub-graph of G. Therefore, if we remove the matching $M_1$ from the original graph $G_0$, we get a new $(k-1)$-regular graph $G_1 = (A \\cup B, E \\setminus M)$. Now we repeat the process $k$ times. Formally, at each iteration $i = 1, \\dots, k$, we start with $(k-i+1)$-regular graph $G_{i-1}$.

Also let $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_k$ denote the columns of $A$ corresponding to the nonzero variables $x^*_1, \\dots, x^*_k$. We start by showing that if $a_1,\\dots, a_k\\in \\mathbb{R}^m$ are linearly dependent then $x^*$ is not an extreme point. This implies that ``any extreme point $x^*$ has at most $m$ non-zero entries, i.e., $|\\{i: x^*_i > 0 \\}| \\leq m$'' since no more than $m$ vectors can be linearly independent in the $m$-dimensional space $\\mathbb{R}^m$. Since we assume $a_1, \\dots, a_k$ to be linearly dependent we can write $\\sum_{i=1}^k \\lambda_i a_i = 0$ for some scalars $\\lambda_i$ that are not all equal to $0$. Now it is easy to verify that for a small enough $\\varepsilon > 0$, \\begin{align*} y := \\left[ \\begin{array}{c} x^*_1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ x^*_k \\\\ x^*_{k+1} \\\\ \\vdots\\\\ x^*_n \\end{array} \\right] + \\varepsilon \\cdot \\left[ \\begin{array}{c} \\lambda_1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\lambda_k \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\vdots\\\\ 0 \\end{array} \\right] \\qquad \\mbox{and} \\qquad z := \\left[ \\begin{array}{c} x^*_1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ x^*_k \\\\ x^*_{k+1} \\\\ \\vdots\\\\ x^*_n \\end{array} \\right] - \\varepsilon \\cdot \\left[ \\begin{array}{c} \\lambda_1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\lambda_k \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\vdots\\\\ 0 \\end{array} \\right] \\end{align*} are both feasible solutions to the linear program and $x^* = \\tfrac{y+z}{2}$ and thus $x^*$ is not an extreme point. We now complete the proof of the good mood problem by showing that if $x^*$ is not an extreme point, then $a_1, \\dots, a_k$ are linearly dependent. If $x^*$ is not an extreme point, then there is a vector $y\\in \\mathbb{R}^n \\setminus \\{0\\}$ such that $x^*+y$ is feasible and $x^*-y$ is feasible. By simple rewriting, $Ax = b$ and $A(x+y) = b$ imply $Ay = 0$, i.e., $\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i y_i =0$. By the nonnegativity constraints, we must have $y_{i} = 0$ for all $i>k$ (for suppose that $y_i > 0$ and $x^*_i = 0$; then either $x^*-y$ or $x^*+y$ would need to be negative on coordinate $i$ and thus infeasible). Hence we have that $\\sum_{i=1}^k a_i y_i =0$, which shows that the vectors $a_1, \\dots, a_k$ are linearly dependent. In the proofs above we used that $x^*$ is not an extreme point (i.e., it can be written as a convex combination of other feasible vectors) if and only if it can be written as a convex combination of \\textbf{two} other feasible vectors. The proof here is as follows: suppose that $x^* = \\sum_{i = 1}^n \\lambda_i y_i$ for $\\lambda_1, ..., \\lambda_n > 0$, $\\sum_i \\lambda_i = 1$ and $y_1 \\ne x^*$. Then we can rewrite \\[ x^* = \\sum_{i = 1}^n \\lambda_i y_i = \\lambda_1 y_1 + \\sum_{i=2}^n \\lambda_i y_i = \\lambda_1 y_i + (1 - \\lambda_1) \\cdot \\left( \\sum_{i=2}^n \\frac{\\lambda_i}{1 - \\lambda_1} y_i \\right) \\] which is a convex combination of two other feasible points. The point $\\sum_{i=2}^n \\frac{\\lambda_i}{1 - \\lambda_1} y_i$ is feasible as a convex combination of feasible points (note that $\\sum_{i=2}^n \\lambda_i = 1 - \\lambda_1$).",

In the case of investments, we want to do almost as good as the best investment. Let $g_i^t$ be the fractional change of the value of $i$'th investment at time $t$. I.e., $g_i^t = (100 + change(i))/100$, and $p_i^{t+1} = p_i^{t} \\cdot g_i^t$. Thus, after time $T$, $p_i^{T+1} = p_i^1 \\prod_{t = 1}^T g_i^t$. To get an analogous bound to that of the Hedge algorithm, we take the logarithm. The logarithm of the total gain would be $\\sum_{t=1}^T \\ln g_i^t$. To convert this into a loss, we multiply this by $-1$, which gives a loss of $\\sum_{t=1}^T (- \\ln g_i^t)$.

Note that $E_f$ must then contain a cycle as $b$ is integral: indeed any vertex incident to an edge in $E_f$ is incident to at least two edges in $E_f$. Note that since $G$ is bipartite, hence, the cycle has even length. Let $e_1, e_2, ..., e_{2k}$ be the edges of the cycle.

More formally suppose that $e_i$ and $e_{i+1}$ are the edges incident to $v$. Depending on parity of $i$ we have $y_{e_i}=x^{*}_{e_i}+\\epsilon$ and $y_{e_{i+1}}=x^{*}_{e_{i+1}}-\\epsilon$.

If $x_1 = y_1$ and $x_2 = y_2$, Bob outputs $\\textsc{Equal}$. Otherwise, Bob outputs $\\textsc{Not Equal}$. We prove that the above protocol succeeds with probability at least $2/3$. Clearly, it succeeds whenever $\\mathbf{a} = \\mathbf{b}$. Thus, we only have to show that it succeeds with probability at least $2/3$ when $\\mathbf{a} \\neq \\mathbf{b}$.

A spam filter is an algorithm that takes as input an email and outputs $1$ if the email is spam and $0$ otherwise.   Alice and Bob now want to compare their two spam filters. To perform the comparison, they both download the same huge data set consisting of $n$ emails out of which some are spam.  Alice then runs her spam filter on the data set  to obtain $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ where $a_i \\in \\{0,1\\}$ is the output of her spam filter on the $i$:th email in the data set. Similarly, Bob runs his spam filter on the data set to obtain $b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$ where $b_i \\in \\{0,1\\}$ is the output of his spam filter on the $i$:th email in the data set. Their goal is then to  determine whether their outputs are the same. An issue that they face is that $a_1, a_2,\\ldots, a_n$ are stored on Alice's computer  and $b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$ are stored on Bob's computer. They thus need to transfer (or communicate) information to solve the problem. A trivial solution is for Alice to transfer all her outputs  $a_1, a_2,\\ldots, a_n$ to Bob who then performs the comparison.

Therefore, this will cause an increase in the bandgap and so a shift to higher energies of the optical emission. It will also lead to a decrease in the electrical conductivity.

        "explanation": "Anisotropic etching baths can be used for making very thin Si membranes of the order of 1 µm thickness. A single crystalline Si substrate is normally around 500 µm thickness. If we have a mask opening structure and put the Si wafer in a KOH bath, the etching stops at certain planes of the crystal, usually the (111) planes. If we proceed in time, the thickness of the Si substrate in the middle becomes always smaller, but it is impossible to stop this process exactly when there is only 1 µm left. One can implant boron in a very thin layer and, when the KOH etchant reaches the boron-implanted layer, the etching stops. This method that is used to structure micron-features into thick Si substrates is also named “bulk micromachining”.

Depositing a Cr adhesion layer before the gold film or using sputtering instead of evaporation are the correct solutions. As discussed in the slide about adhesion in the film growth section, the purpose of an adhesion layer is to improve adhesion of noble metals to the substrate. Cr and Ti layers can be used as adhesion layers but platinum is a noble metal and cannot be used as adhesion layer. With sputtering, more energetic atoms impinge on the surface which knock out surface contamination and loosely bound atoms, thus increasing the deposited film adhesion.

Increasing the sputtering rate is a correct solution. Using evaporation instead of sputtering is also correct as evaporated atoms arrive on the substrate with less energy than sputtered atoms. Finally, using magnetron sputtering will decrease the substrate heating and is also a possible solution. There is one point which is worth to notice here.

        "question": "Dimensional analysis is a physical concept that helps understanding physical situations in which various physical quantities are used. It is also used to hypothetically link different physical quantities that can then be verified experimentally. For every physical quantity, there is a corresponding dimension, associated in mechanics to length ($L$), mass ($M$), time ($T$) and their combinations. For instance, the physical dimension of ``velocity'' $v$ is length/time ($L/T$). The unit and dimension of a physical quantity are of course related but they are not identical. The units are defined by conventions (e.g. the International system of units, in short $SI$). According to different conventions, length can have different units, such as an inch or a meter, but it always has the same dimension : $L$. With the SI convention, the units $L$, $M$ and $T$ are respectively metre (m), kilogram (kg) and second (s). These dimensions, respectively units, are used to express the units of all mechanical quantities. For instance, the velocity : \\begin{equation*} v = \\frac{L}{T}\\qquad \\text{therefore}\\qquad v = \\left[\\frac{\\text{m}}{\\text{s}}\\right] \\end{equation*} \n\n\\noindent Basic concepts of dimensional analysis :\n%\n\\begin{enumerate}\n%\n\\item Only physical quantities of the same dimension (units) can be added, subtracted, compared or equated.\n%\n\\item Quantities of different dimensions can only be multiplied or divided.\n%\t\n\\item When a quantity is raised to a rational power, its dimension is raised to the same power.\n%\n\\item The exponents are always dimensionless.\n%\t\n\\item Mathematical functions such as exponents, logarithms, trigonometric functions, etc. have dimensionless arguments.\n%\n\\item All equations have to be homogeneous. The dimension on the left hand side has to be the same as the one on the right hand side.\n%\n\\end{enumerate}\n%\nWe will use dimensional analysis for the SI units to name the corresponding dimensions : $L$ $\\rightarrow$ m (metre), $M$ $\\rightarrow$ kg (kilogram), $T$ $\\rightarrow$ s (second).\n\nDetermine the dimension of the universal gravitational constant $G$ that makes the expression of the gravitational force $F_G$ homogeneous and deduce the corresponding unit in the SI system,\n%\n\\begin{equation*}\nF_G = G\\,\\frac{M_1 M_2}{r^2}\n\\end{equation*}\n%\nwhere $M_1$ and $M_2$ are two masses that are a distance $r$ apart.",

        "question": "In class, we studied extensively the coloring problem of random regular graphs. In this exercise, we will consider a variant of the problem called circular coloring, still on random regular graphs of degree d. The color-variables si on the nodes of the graph can take one of q colors, si ∈ {1, . . . , q}. The rule of circular coloring is that the two nodes of each edge can take two consecutive colors modulo q. For instance, for q = 4 only the following color combinations are allowed for a given edge {(1, 2),(2, 3),(3, 4),(4, 1)} (in contrast with the normal graph coloring pairs (1, 3) and (2, 4) are not allowed for circular coloring). A graph is considered circular q-colorable if and only if there is an assignment of colors to nodes such that each edge is in the allowed list. Does the belief propagation have a trivial fixed point you can guess ? What is the entropy for that fixed point ?",

In this model we can conveniently approximate: $$ \\sum_{j \\neq i} \\frac{S_j}{N}=\\sum_j \\frac{S_j}{N}+O\\left(\\frac{1}{N}\\right) $$ and replace the interaction by an effective field of intensity $\\bar{S}$, equal for all spins.

Now, we know that the Boltzmann-Gibbs measure peaks on the minima of the energy when the temperature is sent to 0 , i.e. when $\\beta \\rightarrow \\infty$. If we take the same limit in our factorized probability distribution, we immediately see that the probability for each spin will become a Kronecker's $\\delta$, depending only on the sign of the local field: $$ Q_{M F}\\left(S_i=S\\right) \\stackrel{\\beta \\rightarrow \\infty}{=} \\delta_{S, \\operatorname{sign}\\left(h_i+\\bar{S}\\right)} . $$ This suggests us a greedy algorithm (i.e., working directly at zero temperature) for descending our discrete energy landscape: align each spin with the corresponding local field, recompute the effective field, and iterate: $$ S_i^{(t+1)}=\\operatorname{sign}\\left(h_i+\\sum_{j=1}^N S_j^{(t)}\\right) $$ In general, greedy optimization algorithms are prone to getting trapped in local minima, but we will see in the following that in this case the algorithm works like a charm.",

        "answer": "In a $d$-regular graph $G$, every variable node (recall these are the edges of $G$ ) has degree 2, and every factor node has degree $d$ (recall these are the nodes of $G$ ). The local structure of every variable and factor node are identical, and therefore we do not need to distinguish them. This motivates the following ansatz for the messages: $$ \\chi_S^{(i j) \\rightarrow i}=\\chi_S, \\quad \\psi_S^{i \\rightarrow(i j)}=\\psi_S $$ The BP equations therefore simplify considerably: $$ \\psi_S \\propto \\sum_{\\left\\{S_l\\right\\}_{l=1}^{d-1}} \\mathbb{I}\\left(S+\\sum_{l=1}^{d-1} S_l \\leq 1\\right) \\prod_{l=1}^{d-1} \\chi_{S_l}, \\quad \\chi_S=e^{\\beta S} \\psi_S $$ Therefore, parametrising $\\Psi_1=a, \\Psi_0=1-a$, we get the following set of two equations: $$ \\Psi_1 \\epsilonquiv a=\\frac{1}{Z}(1-a)^{d-1}, \\quad \\Psi_0 \\epsilonquiv 1-a=\\frac{1}{Z}\\left((1-a)^{d-1}+(d-1) e^\\beta a(1-a)^{d-2}\\right) $$ where the first expression accounts for $S=1$ (so all neighbours $S_l=0$ to satisfy the matching constraint) and the second term for $S=0$, where any of the other $d-1$ neighbours can take $S_l=1$. Note moreover that the normalisation are the same, and therefore we can close the equations on $a$ : $$ \\frac{1-a}{a}=1+(d-1) \\frac{a}{1-a} e^\\beta $$ This is a simple quadratic equation on $x=\\frac{1-a}{a}$, and can be solved exactly to give: $$ a^{\\star}=\\frac{2}{3+\\sqrt{1+4 e^\\beta(d-1)}} $$ On the homogeneous ansatz, the Bethe free entropy can also be simplified: $$ \\Phi_{\\mathrm{Bethe}}=\\log \\left((1-a)^d+d e^\\beta a(1-a)^{d-1}\\right)-\\frac{d}{2} \\log \\left(e^\\beta a^2+(1-a)^2\\right) $$ Similarly, we can also compute the energy as a function of $a$ by taking the derivative of $\\Phi_{\\text {Bethe }}$ and remembering that the $\\mathrm{BP}$ are stationary points of the Bethe free energy: $$ e^*=\\left.\\partial_\\beta \\Phi_{\\text {Bethe }}\\right|_{a=a^{\\star}}=\\frac{d a^{\\star}\\left(1-a^{\\star}\\right)^{d-1} e^\\beta}{\\left(1-a^{\\star}\\right)^d+d e^\\beta a^{\\star}\\left(1-a^{\\star}\\right)^{d-1}}-\\frac{d}{2} \\frac{a^{\\star 2} e^\\beta}{e^\\beta a^{\\star 2}+\\left(1-a^{\\star}\\right)^2} $$ Finally, the entropy (and therefore the total number of matchings at fixed matching size) is given by: $s\\left(e^{\\star}\\right)=\\Phi_{\\text {Bethe }}(\\beta)-\\beta e^{\\star}$. Although we don't have a closed form expression for the entropy, it can be easily plotted parametrically in $\\beta$ for a fixed $d$.

So $|M| \\leq N / 2$ (at most $N / 2$ matchings). - The $d=2$ regular graph is just a chain of nodes. In this case, there are only 2 ways of matching all the nodes available, and therefore $s(1 / 2)=0$. - As the figure suggests, the larger the degree $d$, the easier it is to find a matching which is quite intuitive.",

        "answer": "In order to obtain the sought expression for the BP free entropy we will work on the actual factor graph of the model, where each pair of nodes $i$ and $j$ will be connected to a pairwise interaction factor $(i j)$. On the edges, we will denote as $\\psi_a^{i \\rightarrow(i j)}$ the message sent from $i$ to $(i j)$, representing the cavity marginal corresponding to \"color\" $a$, and as $\\chi_a^{(i j) \\rightarrow i}$ the message sent from (ij) to $i$, representing the probability of \"color\" $a$ being the correct assignment for variable $i$ given the constraint $(i j)$. Remember that each variable also receives an external field of intensity $\\log n_a$, representing the prior on the size of the communities. Finally, $\\psi_a^i$ will denote the marginal of variable i. We are going to repeatedly use the BP equation: $$ \\chi_a^{(i j) \\rightarrow i}=\\frac{1}{Z_{(i j) \\rightarrow i}} \\sum_b \\psi_b^{j \\rightarrow(i j)}\\left[\\left(1-A_{i j}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{c_{a b}}{N}\\right)+A_{i j} c_{a b}\\right] $$ where $Z_{(i j) \\rightarrow i}$ is simply obtained by summing over $a$ the numerator. The general expression for the Bethe free-entropy reads: $$ \\Phi_{\\mathrm{BP}}=\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_i \\log Z_i+\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{(i j)} \\log Z_{(i j)}-\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i(i j)} \\log Z_{i(i j)} $$ and thus we can proceed by evaluating all the terms separately and then putting all the pieces together (as usual we expect some cancellations). Note that the notation is a bit overloaded, but the difference is deliberate: $Z_i, Z_{(i j}$ in the previous expression are actually different from $Z^i, Z^{i j}$ in equation 1.1. We start with the variable contribution: $$ \\begin{aligned} & Z_i=\\sum_a n_a \\prod_{(i j)} \\chi_a^{(i j) \\rightarrow i} \\\\ & \\stackrel{(*)}{=} \\sum_a n_a \\prod_{(i j)} \\frac{1}{Z_{(i j) \\rightarrow i}} \\sum_b \\psi_b^{j \\rightarrow(i j)}\\left[\\left(1-A_{i j}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{c_{a b}}{N}\\right)+A_{i j} c_{a b}\\right] \\\\ & \\stackrel{(* *)}{=} \\frac{1}{\\prod_{(i j)} Z_{(i j) \\rightarrow i}} \\sum_a n_a \\prod_{(i j) \\in E}\\left[\\sum_b \\psi_b^{j \\rightarrow(i j)} c_{a b}\\right] \\prod_{(i j) \\notin E}\\left[\\sum_b \\psi_b^{j \\rightarrow(i j)}\\left(1-\\frac{c_{a b}}{N}\\right)\\right] \\text {, } \\\\ & \\epsilonnd{aligned} $$ using the $\\mathrm{BP}$ equation for $\\left(^*\\right)$, and splitting over edge/non-edge contributions in $\\left({ }^{* *}\\right)$. Now, in the second term, we can use the normalization $\\sum_b \\psi_b^{j \\rightarrow(i j)}=1$ and write: $$ \\prod_{(i j) \\notin E}\\left[1-\\sum_b \\psi_b^{j \\rightarrow(i j)} \\frac{c_{a b}}{N}\\right] \\stackrel{(*)}{\\approx} e^{-\\sum_{(i j) \\notin E} \\sum_b \\psi_b^{j \\rightarrow(i j)} \\frac{c_{a b}}{N}} \\stackrel{(* *)}{\\approx} e^{-h_a} $$ where, as in the lecture, we define $h_a=\\sum_j \\sum_b \\psi_b^j \\frac{c_{a b}}{N}$, and where in $\\left(^*\\right)$ we used the fact the we consider the high dimensional limit $N \\rightarrow \\infty$, and in $\\left({ }^{* *}\\right)$ we approximated the sum (up to $\\mathcal{O}(1 / N)$ ) by replacing the sum over the non edges with the sum over all the links, and the cavity marginals with the marginals. Therefore we have: $$ Z_i=\\frac{\\sum_a n_a e^{-h_a} \\prod_{(i j) \\in E}\\left[\\sum_b \\psi_b^{j \\rightarrow(i j)} c_{a b}\\right]}{\\prod_{(i j)} Z_{(i j) \\rightarrow i}}=\\frac{Z^i}{\\prod_{(i j)} Z_{(i j) \\rightarrow i}} $$ Now we can look at the factor contribution: $$ \\begin{aligned} Z_{(i j)} & =\\sum_{a, b} \\psi_a^{i \\rightarrow(i j)} \\psi_b^{j \\rightarrow(i j)}\\left[\\left(1-A_{i j}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{c_{a b}}{N}\\right)+A_{i j} c_{a b}\\right] \\\\ & \\stackrel{(*)}{=} \\mathbb{I}((i j) \\in E) \\sum_{a, b} \\psi_a^{i \\rightarrow(i j)} \\psi_b^{j \\rightarrow(i j)} c_{a b}+\\mathbb{I}((i j) \\notin E) \\sum_{a, b} \\psi_a^{i \\rightarrow(i j)} \\psi_b^{j \\rightarrow(i j)}\\left(1-\\frac{c_{a b}}{N}\\right) \\\\ & \\stackrel{(* *)}{=} \\mathbb{I}((i j) \\in E) \\sum_{a, b} \\psi_a^{i \\rightarrow(i j)} \\psi_b^{j \\rightarrow(i j)} c_{a b}+\\mathbb{I}((i j) \\notin E) e^{-\\sum_{a, b} \\psi_a^{i \\rightarrow(i j)} \\psi_b^{j \\rightarrow(i j)} \\frac{c_{a b}}{N}}, \\epsilonnd{aligned} $$ where we have again split over edge/non-edge contributions in $\\left(^*\\right)$ and exploited the large $N$ limit in $(* *)$. Finally, the edge contribution yields: $$ \\begin{aligned} Z_{i(i j)} & =\\sum_a \\psi_a^{i \\rightarrow(i j)} \\chi_a^{(i j) \\rightarrow i} \\\\ & \\stackrel{(*)}{=} \\sum_a \\psi_a^{i \\rightarrow(i j)} \\frac{1}{Z_{(i j) \\rightarrow i}} \\sum_b \\psi_b^{j \\rightarrow(i j)}\\left[\\left(1-A_{i j}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{c_{a b}}{N}\\right)+A_{i j} c_{a b}\\right] \\\\ & =\\frac{Z_{(i j)}}{Z_{(i j) \\rightarrow i}}, \\epsilonnd{aligned} $$ Putting everything together we get: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\Phi_{\\mathrm{BP}} & =\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_i\\left(\\log Z^i-\\sum_{(i j)} \\log Z_{(i j) \\rightarrow i}\\right)+\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{(i j)} \\log Z_{(i j)}-\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i(i j)}\\left(\\log Z_{(i j)}-\\log Z_{(i j) \\rightarrow i}\\right)(1.17) \\\\ & =\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_i \\log Z^i-\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{(i j)} \\log Z_{(i j)} \\\\ & =\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_i \\log Z^i-\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{(i j) \\in E} \\log \\sum_{a, b} \\psi_a^{i \\rightarrow(i j)} \\psi_b^{j \\rightarrow(i j)} c_{a b}+\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{(i j) \\notin E} \\sum_{a, b} \\psi_a^{i \\rightarrow(i j)} \\psi_b^{j \\rightarrow(i j)} \\frac{c_{a b}}{N}(1.19) \\\\ & \\stackrel{(*)}{\\approx} \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_i \\log Z^i-\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{(i j) \\in E} \\log Z^{i j}+\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{(i j)} \\sum_{a, b} \\psi_a^i \\psi_b^j \\frac{c_{a b}}{N} \\epsilonnd{aligned} $$ where in $\\left(^*\\right)$ we used the fact that the sum over colors can be split in $\\sum_{a, b} f(a, b)=\\sum_{a<b}(f(a, b)+$ $f(b, a))+\\sum_a f(a, a)$ as in expression 1.1 in the assignment, and approximated the sum over non-edges with the sum over all links. Finally, if we look at the last term in equation 1.20 , we can recognize: $$ \\sum_{(i j)} \\sum_{a, b} \\psi_a^i \\psi_b^j \\frac{c_{a b}}{N}=\\langle|E|\\rangle_{\\text {posterior }} \\stackrel{(*)}{=} N \\frac{c}{2} $$ where in $\\left(^*\\right)$ the Nishimori condition guarantees the equivalence between the posterior average and the true generative model.",

Defining the mean magnetisation with respect to $P_{t, m}$ $$ \\langle m(t)\\rangle=\\int d m m P_{t, m} $$ and using the master equation above, we can get an equations for the expected magnetisation: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\langle m(t+\\delta t)\\rangle & =\\int P_{t, m+2 / N} \\times\\left\\{\\frac{1}{2}(1+m+2 / N)\\right\\} \\times \\frac{1-\\tanh (m+2 / N)}{2} \\times m d m \\\\ & +\\int P_{t, m-2 / N}\\left\\{\\frac{1}{2}(1-m+2 / N)\\right\\} \\times \\frac{1+\\tanh (m-2 / N)}{2} \\times m d m \\\\ & +\\int P_{t, m} \\times\\left\\{\\frac{1+m}{2} \\times \\frac{1+\\tanh (m)}{2}+\\frac{1-m}{2} \\times \\frac{1-\\tanh (m)}{2}\\right\\} \\times m d m \\epsilonnd{aligned} $$ 3.

The only term where $n_b$ appears is the first term of eq. 1.3: $$ \\partial_{n_c} \\Phi_{B P}=\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_i \\partial_{n_c} \\log Z_i=\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_i \\frac{e^{-h_c} \\prod_{j \\in \\partial i} \\sum_b \\psi_b^{j \\rightarrow i} c_{c b}}{Z_i}=\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_i \\frac{\\psi_c^i}{n_c} $$ Therefore we have: $$ \\partial_{n_c} \\mathcal{L}=0 \\quad \\longrightarrow \\quad \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_i \\psi_c^i=\\lambda n_c $$ Moreover we also require: $$ \\partial_\\lambda \\mathcal{L}=1-\\sum_a n_a=0 $$ so, if we sum equation 2.6 over the colors we get: $$ \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_i \\sum_c \\psi_c^i \\stackrel{(*)}{=} 1=\\lambda \\sum_c n_c \\stackrel{(* *)}{=} \\lambda, $$ where in $\\left(^*\\right)$ we used the normalization of the messages, and in $\\left(^{* *}\\right)$ we used equation 2.7.

        "question": "In class, we studied extensively the coloring problem of random regular graphs. In this exercise, we will consider a variant of the problem called circular coloring, still on random regular graphs of degree d. The color-variables si on the nodes of the graph can take one of q colors, si ∈ {1, . . . , q}. The rule of circular coloring is that the two nodes of each edge can take two consecutive colors modulo q. For instance, for q = 4 only the following color combinations are allowed for a given edge {(1, 2),(2, 3),(3, 4),(4, 1)} (in contrast with the normal graph coloring pairs (1, 3) and (2, 4) are not allowed for circular coloring). A graph is considered circular q-colorable if and only if there is an assignment of colors to nodes such that each edge is in the allowed list. We will aim at counting how many proper circular q-colorings are there typically in a large d regular graph. Write the Bethe free entropy that you will need to compute this number.",

Let $m_t$ denote the total magnetisation at time $t$, and define $P_{t, m}=\\mathbb{P}\\left(m_t=m\\right)$. For simplicity, consider $\\beta=1$ and $h=0$.

Defining the mean magnetisation with respect to $P_{t, m}$ $$ \\langle m(t)\\rangle=\\int d m m P_{t, m} $$ and using the master equation above, we can get an equations for the expected magnetisation: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\langle m(t+\\delta t)\\rangle & =\\int P_{t, m+2 / N} \\times\\left\\{\\frac{1}{2}(1+m+2 / N)\\right\\} \\times \\frac{1-\\tanh (m+2 / N)}{2} \\times m d m \\\\ & +\\int P_{t, m-2 / N}\\left\\{\\frac{1}{2}(1-m+2 / N)\\right\\} \\times \\frac{1+\\tanh (m-2 / N)}{2} \\times m d m \\\\ & +\\int P_{t, m} \\times\\left\\{\\frac{1+m}{2} \\times \\frac{1+\\tanh (m)}{2}+\\frac{1-m}{2} \\times \\frac{1-\\tanh (m)}{2}\\right\\} \\times m d m \\epsilonnd{aligned} $$ 3.

That's when problems started, your manager says...

Take any computation tree for xs.aggregate. Such a tree has internal nodes labelled by g and segments processed using foldLeft(z)(f). The split-invariance law above says that any internal g-node can be removed by concatenating the segments. By repeating this transformation, we obtain the entire result equals xs.foldLeft(z)(f).  The split-invariance condition uses foldLeft. The following two conditions together imply split-invariance and are expressed without the use of foldLeft:  forall u. g(u,z) == u                       (g-right-unit) forall u, v. g(u, f(v,x)) == f(g(u,v), x)   (g-f-assoc) To see that these conditions imply split-invariance, assume g-right-unit and g-f-assoc. We wish to prove split-invariance. We do so by (total) induction on the length of ys. If ys has length zero, then ys.foldLeft gives z, so by g-right-unit both sides reduce to xs.foldLeft. Let ys have length n>0 and assume by I.H. that split-invariance holds for all ys of length strictly less than n. Let ys == ys1 :+ y (that is, y is the last element of ys). Then  g(xs.F, (ys1 :+ y).F) == (foldLeft definition) g(xs.F, f(ys1.F, y))  == (by g-f-assoc) f(g(xs.F, ys1.F), y)  == (by I.H.) f((xs++ys1).F, y)     == (foldLeft definition) ((xs++ys1) :+ y).F    == (properties of lists) (xs++(ys1 :+ y)).F",

Above the threshold, the algorithm is applied recursively over the two halves of the array. The results are then merged using an operation that takes d units of time.

That's when problems started, your manager says...  Here is the code responsible to withdraw money from the account from and transfer it to the account to, within the same bank:  def transfer(from: Account, to: Account, amount: BigInt): Unit = {   require(amount >= 0)    val balanceFrom = from.balance    if (balanceFrom >= amount) {     from.balance = balanceFrom - amount     val balanceTo = to.balance     to.balance = balanceTo + amount   } } For the bank, it is very important that the following two properties hold after any sequence of completed transfer transactions:  The balance of an account never goes below 0.

        "question": "We learnt in the lecture that terms are typically stored in an inverted list. Now, in the inverted list, instead of only storing document identifiers of the documents in which the term appears, assume we also store an *offset* of the appearance of a term in a document. An $offset$ of a term $l_k$ given a document is defined as the number of words between the start of the document and $l_k$. Thus our inverted list is now:  $l_k= \\langle f_k: \\{d_{i_1} \\rightarrow [o_1,\\ldots,o_{n_{i_1}}]\\},  \\{d_{i_2} \\rightarrow [o_1,\\ldots,o_{n_{i_2}}]\\}, \\ldots,  \\{d_{i_k} \\rightarrow [o_1,\\ldots,o_{n_{i_k}}]\\} \\rangle$  This means that in document $d_{i_1}$ term $l_k$ appears $n_{i_1}$ times and at offset $[o_1,\\ldots,o_{n_{i_1}}]$, where $[o_1,\\ldots,o_{n_{i_1}}]$ are sorted in ascending order, these type of indices are also known as term-offset indices. An example of a term-offset index is as follows:  **Obama** = $⟨4 : {1 → [3]},{2 → [6]},{3 → [2,17]},{4 → [1]}⟩$  **Governor** = $⟨2 : {4 → [3]}, {7 → [14]}⟩$  **Election** = $⟨4 : {1 → [1]},{2 → [1,21]},{3 → [3]},{5 → [16,22,51]}⟩$  Which is to say that the term **Governor** appear in 2 documents. In document 4 at offset 3, in document 7 at offset 14. Now let us consider the *SLOP/x* operator in text retrieval. This operator has the syntax: *QueryTerm1 SLOP/x QueryTerm2* finds occurrences of *QueryTerm1* within $x$ (but not necessarily in that order) words of *QueryTerm2*, where $x$ is a positive integer argument ($x \\geq 1$). Thus $x = 1$ demands that *QueryTerm1* be adjacent to *QueryTerm2*.  Consider the general procedure for \"merging\" two term-offset inverted lists for a given document, to determine where the document satisfies a *SLOP/x* clause (since in general there will be many offsets at which each term occurs in a document). Let $L$ denote the total number of occurrences of the two terms in the document. Assume we have a pointer to the list of occurrences of each term and can move the pointer along this list. As we do so we check whether we have a hit for $SLOP/x$ (i.e. the $SLOP/x$ clause is satisfied). Each move of either pointer counts as a step. Based on this assumption is there a general \"merging\" procedure to determine whether the document satisfies a $SLOP/x$ clause, for which the following is true? Justify your answer.      1. The merge can be accomplished in a number of steps linear in $L$ regardless of $x$, and we can ensure that each pointer moves only to the right (i.e. forward).     2. The merge can be accomplished in a number of steps linear in $L$, but a pointer may be forced to move to the left (i.e. backwards).     3. The merge can require $x \\times L$ steps in some cases.",

        "question": "Following the notation used in class, let us denote the set of terms by $T=\\{k_i|i=1,...,m\\}$, the set of documents by $D=\\{d_j |j=1,...,n\\}$, and let $d_i=(w_{1j},w_{2j},...,w_{mj})$. We are also given a query  $q=(w_{1q},w_{2q},...,w_{mq})$. In the lecture we studied that,   $sim(q,d_j) = \\sum^m_{i=1} \\frac{w_{ij}}{|d_j|}\\frac{w_{iq}}{|q|}$ .  (1)  Another way of looking at the information retrieval problem is using a probabilistic approach. The probabilistic view of information retrieval consists of determining the conditional probability $P(q|d_j)$ that for a given document $d_j$ the query by the user is $q$. So, practically in probabilistic retrieval when a query $q$ is given, for each document it is evaluated how probable it is that the query is indeed relevant for the document, which results in a ranking of the documents.  In order to relate vector space retrieval to a probabilistic view of information retrieval, we interpret the weights in Equation (1) as follows:  -  $w_{ij}/|d_j|$ can be interpreted as the conditional probability $P(k_i|d_j)$ that for a given document $d_j$ the term $k_i$ is important (to characterize the document $d_j$).  -  $w_{iq}/|q|$ can be interpreted as the conditional probability $P(q|k_i)$ that for a given term $k_i$ the query posed by the user is $q$. Intuitively, $P(q|k_i)$ gives the amount of importance given to a particular term while querying.  With this interpretation you can rewrite Equation (1) as follows:  $sim(q,d_j) = \\sum^m_{i=1} P(k_i|d_j)P(q|k_i)$ (2)  Note that the model described in Question (a) provides a probabilistic interpretation for vector space retrieval where weights are interpreted as probabilities . Compare to the probabilistic retrieval model based on language models introduced in the lecture and discuss the differences.",

Using SGD, we want to solve the following problem: $$ \\min _{\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^p} f(\\mathbf{x}) $$ where $f$ is a non-smooth, convex function. Recall the SGD update: $\\mathbf{x}^{k+1}=\\mathbf{x}^k-\\alpha_k \\tilde{\\mathbf{g}}_k$, where $\\tilde{\\mathbf{g}}_k$ is a stochastic subgradient estimate for $f$ at $\\mathbf{x}^k$.

        "explanation": "BOLD contrast is a technique used in functional MRI (fMRI). The BOLD effect is directly related to the concentration of deoxy-hemoglobin, which varies from less than 2% in arterial blood to greater than 40% in venous blood.  Neuronal activity causes an increase in oxygen consumption and an even larger increase in local blood flow (neurovascular coupling). The increase of the flow rate is greater than the increase in oxygen consumption and neuronal activation results in a relative increase in oxyhemoglobin compared to deoxyhemoglobin in the activated zones. This relative decline in the concentration of deoxyhemoglobin, which has a paramagnetic effect, can be detected by MRI as a low transient increase in signal in \\(T_2^*\\) weighting. This is the principle of contrast BOLD (Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent).",

Ainsi,  $\\Sigma=\\begin{pmatrix}{\\sqrt{18}}&0\\\\  0&{0} \\\\ 0&0 \\end{pmatrix}=\\begin{pmatrix}{3\\sqrt{2}}&0\\\\  0&{0} \\\\ 0&0 \\end{pmatrix} $ (on ordonne les valeurs singuli\\`eres dans l'ordre d\\'ecroissant), et on obtient ainsi la matrice orthogonale $V$: $$V=\\frac1{\\sqrt2}\\begin{pmatrix}1&1\\\\  -1&1 \\end{pmatrix}. $$ La matrice $U$ s'obtient en normalisant les vecteurs $Av_i$ avec $v_i$ associ\\'e \\`a une valeur singuli\\`ere non nulle, ici il y en a un seul: $Av_1=\\frac1{\\sqrt2}\\begin{pmatrix} 2\\\\-4\\\\4 \\end{pmatrix}$. Ainsi $$u_1:=\\frac1{\\|Av_1\\|} Av_1 = \\frac13 \\begin{pmatrix} 1\\\\-2\\\\2 \\end{pmatrix}.$$ Les autres colonnes de $U$ s'obtiennent en \\'etendant la famille $\\{u_1\\}$ \\`a une base orthonorm\\'ee de $\\mathbb{R}^3$. Il faut donc trouver deux vecteurs norm\\'es $u_2,u_3$  orthogonaux  solutions de l'\\'equation $u_1\\cdot x=0$. Une base de solution est  $$ w_1= \\begin{pmatrix} 0\\\\1\\\\1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad w_2=\\begin{pmatrix} -2\\\\0\\\\1 \\end{pmatrix} $$ On applique l'algorithme de Gram-Schmidt pour orthonomaliser la famille $\\{w_1, w_2\\}$.

Pour \\'eviter de recourir \\`a l'algorithme de Gram-Schmidt pour compl\\'eter la matrice $U$ (voir M\\'ethode 1), on peut calculer la d\\'ecomposition en valeurs  singuli\\`eres de la matrice transpos\\'ee $B=A^T=\\widetilde U \\widetilde \\Sigma \\widetilde V^ T$, puis transposer la d\\'ecomposition obtenue.  On calcule $B^TB=\\begin{pmatrix} 2&-4&4\\\\-4&8&-8 \\\\4 & -8 & 8\\end{pmatrix}$. Les valeurs propres de $B$ sont $18,0,0$ avec pour vecteurs propres associ\\'es $v_1=\\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\-2\\\\2 \\end{pmatrix}, v_2=\\begin{pmatrix}2\\\\1\\\\0 \\end{pmatrix}, v_3=\\begin{pmatrix}2\\\\-4\\\\-5 \\end{pmatrix}$, en choisissant $v_2,v_3$ de sorte que $v_2\\cdot v_3 =0$. Ainsi, $\\widetilde \\Sigma=\\begin{pmatrix}{3\\sqrt{2}}&0&0\\\\  0&{0}&0 \\end{pmatrix}$ et on obtient la matrice $\\widetilde V$ en normalisant les vecteurs $v_1,v_2,v_3$: $$ \\widetilde V=\\begin{pmatrix}\\frac13 &\\frac2{\\sqrt5} &\\frac2{3\\sqrt5}\\\\  -\\frac23 &\\frac1{\\sqrt5}  &-\\frac4{3\\sqrt5} \\\\ \\frac23 &0 &-\\frac5{3\\sqrt5}\\end{pmatrix} $$ Ensuite pour la matrice $\\widetilde U$, on normalise le vecteur $Bv_1$ associ\\'e \\`a une valeur singuli\\`ere non nulle. On obtient: $$ u_1=\\frac1{\\|Bv_1\\|}Bv_1 = \\begin{pmatrix}\\frac1{\\sqrt2} \\\\ -\\frac1{\\sqrt2}\\end{pmatrix} $$ On obtient $u_2$ en prenant un vecteur unitaire orthogonale \\`a $u_1$:  $ u_2=\\begin{pmatrix}\\frac1{\\sqrt2} \\\\ \\frac1{\\sqrt2}\\end{pmatrix} $ d'o\\`u $$ \\widetilde U=\\begin{pmatrix}\\frac1{\\sqrt2} & \\frac1{\\sqrt2}\\\\  -\\frac1{\\sqrt2} & \\frac1{\\sqrt2}\\end{pmatrix} $$ On aboutit \\`a la d\\'ecomposition en valeur singuli\\`ere $$ \\begin{pmatrix}1 &-2 &2\\\\ -1& 2 & -2\\end{pmatrix}= \\begin{pmatrix}\\frac1{\\sqrt2}&\\frac1{\\sqrt2}\\\\  -\\frac1{\\sqrt2}&\\frac1{\\sqrt2} \\end{pmatrix}. \\begin{pmatrix}{3\\sqrt{2}}&0 & 0\\\\  0&{0}&0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac13 & -\\frac23 & \\frac23\\\\  \\frac2{\\sqrt5} &\\frac1{\\sqrt5}  & 0\\\\ \\frac2{3\\sqrt5} &-\\frac4{3\\sqrt5} &-\\frac5{3\\sqrt5}\\end{pmatrix} $$ d'o\\`u, en transposant, $$  \\left(\\begin{array}{cc}1 & -1\\\\-2 & 2\\\\2&-2 \\end{array}\\right)=  \\begin{pmatrix}\\frac13 &\\frac2{\\sqrt5} &\\frac2{3\\sqrt5}\\\\  -\\frac23 &\\frac1{\\sqrt5}  &-\\frac4{3\\sqrt5} \\\\ \\frac23 &0 &-\\frac5{3\\sqrt5}\\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}{3\\sqrt{2}}&0\\\\  0&{0} \\\\ 0&0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}\\frac1{\\sqrt2}&-\\frac1{\\sqrt2}\\\\  \\frac1{\\sqrt2}&\\frac1{\\sqrt2} \\end{pmatrix}. $$(On retrouve bien les mêmes valeurs singulières, mais pas les mêmes matrices\\(U\\) et \\(V\\)).  }",
